Fortunately, there was a Python library, psaw, that simplified calling the API. Without psaw, we need to manually select parameters, craft the URL correct, call it, and parse the answer.\n\n\nFor example, to search for Reddit posts mentioning the word “science”, we need to use the endpoint https://api.pushshift.io/reddit/search/submission/. Therefore, the final query will look like https://api.pushshift.io/reddit/search/submission/?q=science.\n\n`requests` is a general purpose Python library to send HTTP requests, the technical protocol used to communicate with remote APIs. There are different types of HTTP requests that this library support and that you may encounter for more complex APIs (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.). For the purpose of requesting data from the APIs we cover in this couse, we will only need to learn about the GET requests. \n\nThe library is extremely well documented with tutorials: https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/\n",

Wendy answered it.  After about a minute, Wendy shouted, \\\\u201cJim!  Phone call for you!\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Jim got himself up, and he made his way into the hallway.  Jim sat down in the chair beside the table that held the hallway phone.  Jim wondered who would be calling him.  Maybe it was Candi.  Or maybe one of his many friends.  Jim picked up the phone and said, \\\\u201cHello.  Jim Faulkner speaking.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n The voice on the other end said, \\\\u201cHi, Jim Faulkner.  How are you this evening?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n The voice on the other end did not sound familiar to Jim.  That prompted Jim to ask, \\\\u201cMay I ask who\\\\u2019s calling?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n That voice, which was a girl, said to Jim, \\\\u201cI can\\\\u2019t tell you, but I will tell you that I know you.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cHow so?\\\\u201d Jim asked.\\\\n\\\\n The girl said, \\\\u201cI know you hang out at Eastland Mall quite a lot.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Jim said, \\\\u201cYes, I do.  I hang out with my friends.  I have quite a bit of friends.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cI see,\\\\u201d the girl said.\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cI should have you know I do have a girlfriend and we are going steady.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cReally?  Who is she?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cHer name is Candi Robertson.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cYou mean Candice Jade Robertson?  Yeah, I know her.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Once again, Jim asked who the girl was.  She said she could not tell Jim who she is right now, only that she knows him, that he lives on Bethany Street in the Dilworth area of Charlotte, and that he spends some time at Eastland Mall.  Jim had half a mind to ask the girl how she got his phone number.  But he didn\\\\u2019t, because he was quite sure she wouldn\\\\u2019t tell him that, either. \\\\n\\\\nThe girl asked Jim if she could meet him at Eastland Mall the Monday after school let out for the holiday break.  He said he probably could, but he didn\\\\u2019t sound like he was sure.  He told the girl he could not promise anything.  Jim thought one thing.  *To make a promise to a bunch of young people to be friends forever may be one thing.  But to make a promise of any kind to someone I don\\\\u2019t even know, especially a girl around my age, that may be something else again.*\\\\n\\\\n Jim said to the girl, \\\\u201cI\\\\u2019ll see what I can do.  But I\\\\u2019m not sure I can promise anything.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n The girl said, \\\\u201cOkay, Jim.  I\\\\u2019ll be there then.  If you do show up at Eastland Mall, please meet me in front of Chick-fil-A.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Jim said he would try.  And with that, they ended the call.\\\\n\\\\n A few minutes later, Wendy stepped into Jim\\\\u2019s bedroom, and she asked him, \\\\u201cJim, who was that on the phone?  One of your friends?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cNo, Mom.  Not exactly.  Some girl who claims she knows me.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cDoes she have a name?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cMom, I asked her.  She said she could not tell me her name.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cOh, Jim.  That sounds rather rude.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cRude, maybe.  Weird, probably.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cHow did she get our phone number?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Jim thought about how to answer that.  He knew their number was never unlisted.  Wendy did want to have the number unlisted at one point, but she decided against it because she was not sure if she could afford to pay to have it unlisted.  After Wendy decided against it, she never thought of it again.  Finally, Jim answered Wendy\\\\u2019s question by saying, \\\\u201cMom, I\\\\u2019m not sure.  The girl did say she knew Candi.  But I don\\\\u2019t think Candi would give anyone our phone number, or even her own.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cOkay, Jim.  Did she say anything about wanting to meet you?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cYes, Mom.  She said she wishes to meet with me at Eastland Mall the Monday after school\\\\u2019s out for the holidays.  She said we could meet at Chick-fil-A.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cAre you planning to meet her?\\\\u201d Wendy asked.\\\\n\\\\n Jim answered, \\\\u201cI guess.  She could be a potential friend.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Then Wendy said, \\\\u201cOkay, Jim.  Just be careful, okay?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cOkay, Mom.  You know I am always careful.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Wendy smiled and headed for the bedroom door.  She opened the door.  Before she stepped out, she turned around and said to Jim, \\\\u201cI will be working tomorrow until around two.  But I won\\\\u2019t be coming straight home.  I have a doctor\\\\u2019s appointment and I may be home quite late tomorrow evening.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Jim said, \\\\u201cSure, Mom.  What kind of appointment?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cI\\\\u2019ve not been feeling well lately.  I\\\\u2019m just going to have Doctor Firestone check me out.  Nothing major, nothing earth-shattering for you to worry about.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nJim looked at Wendy and gave her a nod.  After Wendy stepped out of the room, Jim thought, *Nothing to worry about, all right.  The only thing I have to worry about at this point is a girl I don\\\\u2019t know trying to meet me and maybe trying to get me to be her boyfriend.  I have a girlfriend.  Candi.  She\\\\u2019s my one and only*.\\\\n\\\\n Just before Jim went to bed, it hit him.  A few months ago, Candi spoke to a girl at Eastland Mall while Jim and Ariel and Jodi were there.  Was there a possibility that could be the girl who called?  Maybe.  Jim would soon find out.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ud83d\\\\ude0a\\\\n\\\\nThe next day, Jim worked some after school at Gilmore Auto Sales.  While Jim was washing a car, he said, \\\\u201cPaulina, I feel like some kind of a freak.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Paulina was washing a car next to the one Jim was washing.  She asked him, \\\\u201cHow can you feel like that?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cSome girl who I do not know calls me, does not tell me who she is, and claims she knows quite a bit about me.  That\\\\u2019s weird.  How do you explain that?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cYou\\\\u2019re right, Jim.  That is weird.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Jim said, \\\\u201cThen I happened to remember something.  A few months ago, Ariel and Jodi and I were hanging out at Eastland Mall.  That same evening, Candi spoke to a girl at the mall who claimed she knows me.  I wonder if that\\\\u2019s the girl who called me last night.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cJim, she very well could be,\\\\u201d Paulina said.\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cShe wants to meet me at Eastland Mall the Monday after school\\\\u2019s out for the holiday break.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cAre you planning to meet her?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cI don\\\\u2019t know.  Maybe.  Depends on whether or not I\\\\u2019m at the mall on that day.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Then Paulina said, \\\\u201cJim, I know a girl at school who had the same thing happen to her.  About a couple months ago, she got a call from some boy.  She met the boy at a Winn-Dixie on East Independence Boulevard.  It turned out the boy was that girl\\\\u2019s brother.  She kept denying it, saying she had always been an only child.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Jim gave Paulina a rather strange look.  Then he said, \\\\u201cPaulina, I can\\\\u2019t believe you told a story like that.  True, I haven\\\\u2019t seen my father in many years.  But I have no brothers or sisters, at least not that I know of.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Paulina gave Jim a serious look and said, \\\\u201cJim, it could happen.  You just said it yourself.  You haven\\\\u2019t seen your father in years.  A lot can happen.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Jim turned around and looked at the Charlotte skyline, took in a deep breath, let it out slowly, and then he said, \\\\u201cYeah, Paulina.  I guess you\\\\u2019re right.  Maybe I should meet this girl and see if she truly is my sister.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cMy brothers and I haven\\\\u2019t seen our father in about a couple years.  Mom says we may never see him again.  It seems as though Russell and Scout could be all I\\\\u2019ll ever have for brothers, unless there\\\\u2019s a brother or sister out there we don\\\\u2019t know about.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Then Jim said, \\\\u201cMy Mom had a doctor\\\\u2019s appointment today.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cDid she say why?\\\\u201d Paulina asked.\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cShe didn\\\\u2019t say.  Maybe a check-up or something.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Paulina said, \\\\u201cYeah.  Or something.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Then Paulina walked to where Jim was.  Then she said to him, \\\\u201cJim, I have been looking at Wendy a lot at church.  She seemed a little different.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cHow different?\\\\u201d Jim asked.\\\\n\\\\n Paulina pointed to her belly.  Then she said, \\\\u201cJim, her belly looked different.  Is there any possibility she could be\\\\u2026pregnant?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Jim gave Paulina a look and said, \\\\u201cNo.  I don\\\\u2019t think so.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Paulina said, \\\\u201cYeah, sure.  We\\\\u2019ll just drop it.  Forget I asked.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Then Jim said, \\\\u201cMom has been dating quite a bit.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Paulina said, \\\\u201cYeah.  So I heard.  Is it serious?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Jim answered, \\\\u201cNo, I don\\\\u2019t think so.  Nothing more than casual.  At least, as far as I know.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Then Pam stepped out of the office and walked to where Jim and Paulina were.  Pam walked toward Jim and said, \\\\u201cJim, I wonder if I could see you inside.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cSure, Pam.  Something wrong?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cNo, Jim.  Nothing bad.  I just need to speak to you for a minute.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Jim walked to where Pam was standing.  Pam said, \\\\u201cPaulina, you just keep washing.  Jim will be back in a moment.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Pam put her arm around Jim while they walked into the office.  Pam told Jim to sit down while she got a couple bottles of Coke.  The stereo in the office was set to a soft rock station.  Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway.  *The Closer I Get to You*.  Jim listened to it for a minute.  He would listen to some music when he got home.  He hoped that song would play sometime during the evening.  Maybe he would call Candi and put the phone to the speaker and play that song for her.  Or better, maybe Candi would visit his house this evening.  If that would be the case, maybe that song would play while she was there.  Pam stepped into the office with the two bottles of Coke. She gave one of those bottles to Jim.  Then Pam stepped to the stereo and got ready to turn the music down.  The song was still playing.  Jim said to her, \\\\u201cNo, Pam.  Leave it where it\\\\u2019s at.  That\\\\u2019s a beautiful song.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Pam turned to Jim and said, \\\\u201cOkay, Jim.  If you say so.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Pam got ready to sit down when she said, \\\\u201cYou, listening to that song.  I\\\\u2019ll bet you\\\\u2019re thinking about Candi, aren\\\\u2019t you?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cYes, Pam.  I guess you could say I am.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cI know, Jim.  I\\\\u2019ve also been thinking about someone else.  You.  And your mother.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cHow so?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cI understand you got a phone call from a girl last night.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Jim turned around and got a look at Paulina.  She was now washing another car.  Then Jim said, \\\\u201cWord sure does get around.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cIt does,\\\\u201d Pam said.\\\\n\\\\n Then Jim asked Pam, \\\\u201cWhere did you hear that?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Pam answered, \\\\u201cI spoke to your mother this morning.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Then Jim told Pam about the details about the phone call.  He said, \\\\u201cSome girl who I don\\\\u2019t know but who claims she knows me calls me, won\\\\u2019t tell me who she is or how she got my number, and who wants to meet me after school\\\\u2019s out for the holidays.  Does that just about cover it?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Then Pam asked Jim, \\\\u201cDoesn\\\\u2019t that strike you as a little strange?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Jim answered, \\\\u201cI suppose it does.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cI know it does.  Especially if she does not tell you who she is or why she wants to have any communication with you.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cI hope she does call again because I wish to find out who she is and how she knows me.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Then Pam shifted to another subject.  \\\\u201cJim, is your mother okay?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cShe is.  Why would you ask?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cI\\\\u2019ve seen her in church.  And I know she\\\\u2019s dating someone.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Jim said, \\\\u201cI know she is.  She doesn\\\\u2019t bring him by the house.  I haven\\\\u2019t met him.  I don\\\\u2019t think it\\\\u2019s anything serious.  Sometimes she doesn\\\\u2019t get home until quite late.  Then again, I do keep some weird hours between studying and working here.  Maybe I\\\\u2019m out of the house quite a bit.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cYes, Jim.  And you are doing a good job.  Both at school and for me.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cThanks, Pam.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cJim, is it just me or has your mother gained a bit of weight?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cMom does eat enough to feed a mule.  I must admit I do, too.  Maybe she has gained a little weight.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Pam began to ask if Wendy was pregnant.  But she didn\\\\u2019t ask.  Instead, she said, \\\\u201cOkay, Jim.  Don\\\\u2019t say anything about that to her.  We won\\\\u2019t hurt her feelings.  Just forget I asked.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cYeah, Pam.  Sure.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Pam excused Jim to continue washing cars.  He got ready to finish the car he was working on.  Paulina was playing a radio at the car she was working on.  The radio was set to an oldies station, playing Andy Williams.  *On the Street Where You Live*.  Jim thought it was a nice song.  It made him think not only of Candi, but of Bethany Street, and the neighborhood.  It made him think of his mother, his friends, and their parents.  And of Gilmore Auto Sales.  And of Charlotte, North Carolina. \\\\n\\\\n Paulina asked, \\\\u201cWhat did you and my mother talk about?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Jim answered, \\\\u201cNot much.  Just about what you and I talked about a while ago.  About that phone call, that girl, and Mom.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cOh, I see.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Then Jim got a look at the car Paulina was washing.  It was rather big.  It was white with a red interior and had roof panels.  \\\\u201cWhat kind of car is that?\\\\u201d Jim asked.\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cMom just got it yesterday.  It\\\\u2019s an Oldsmobile Toronado.  Mom said it\\\\u2019s a 1978 model.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cIt\\\\u2019s big but it looks nice.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Then Paulina pointed to two other cars and said, \\\\u201cMom also got that blue Cadillac and gray Mustang.  Both are 1976.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cWho brought them?\\\\u201d Jim asked.\\\\n\\\\n Paulina answered, \\\\u201cSome automobile wholesale guy in Charlotte who said he was retiring and had three cars left.  He needed to get rid of them and told Mom she could have them to sell.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n That was when they heard the blast of a car horn.  Jim and Paulina both turned to face Mint Street.  They saw a big gray Dodge with a red roof pass the car lot.  Hands waved out of the windows.  Then Jim and Paulina saw who they were.  Mark and Alex were in the front seat.  And in the back seat, Simon, Sydney and Candi.  And driving the car, their mother, Autumn Cavanaugh (Autumn was now driving a late seventies model Dodge).  They also shouted \\\\u201cHi\\\\u201d to Jim and Paulina.  Autumn was driving toward uptown.\\\\n\\\\n Jim and Paulina kept at it for another hour, washing automobile after automobile.  Finally, at around seven, Pam turned off the lights and closed the car lot. \\\\n\\\\nPam offered to drive Jim home.  He happily accepted.  When Jim got home, the lights were still on, including the porch light.  Pam watched Jim go inside.  Wendy stepped outside and waved at Pam and Paulina.  They waved back. \\\\n\\\\n When Jim got inside, he saw his dinner plate on the table.  On it, hamburger steak with Heinz 57, fries with ketchup, salad with blue cheese dressing, onion rings, a bread roll, and a glass of iced tea.  As Jim ate, Wendy asked him how his day went.  He said, \\\\u201cIt went pretty good.  Paulina and Pam both asked me about that phone call I got last night.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cI see.  I\\\\u2019ll bet they found that pretty strange also,\\\\u201d Wendy said.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cYes, Mom.  They did.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cJim, did Pam and Paulina ask anything about me?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cWhat do you mean, Mom?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cI know they have been looking at me and so has everybody else.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cThey did ask about you.  I promised them I wouldn\\\\u2019t say anything to you because they felt it may hurt your feelings.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cJim, just come out with it.  If it does hurt my feelings, no one will know.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Jim said, \\\\u201cThey wondered if you were pregnant.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Wendy said, \\\\u201cI only told Pam I had a doctor\\\\u2019s appointment.  That\\\\u2019s all.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cIt\\\\u2019s okay, Mom.  I told them that I didn\\\\u2019t think you were.  They knew you were dating.  I knew it wasn\\\\u2019t anything more than that.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n And with that, the subject was dropped.  Jim told her dinner was good.  He washed up the dishes, and then he went upstairs to his room.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ud83d\\\\ude0a\\\\n\\\\nJim went to his room to see a car magazine on his bed.  It was a *Road and Track*, and it had three racing cars from the United Kingdom on the cover, a Ferrari and a Jaguar and a Porsche.  Some evenings, Jim would watch TV in his room.  But he decided he would just listen to some music and read his magazine since there was nothing good on TV this evening. \\\\n\\\\n Jim lied down on his bed and read his magazine.  About a half an hour into his magazine, the phone rang.  Jim figured it was for Wendy.  Wendy answered the phone.  Then she shouted from downstairs, \\\\u201cJim!  Phone for you!  It\\\\u2019s Candi!\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Jim walked into the hallway and grabbed the cordless phone from the small hallway table.  He took the phone and went back to his room.  He said, \\\\u201cHi, Candi.  How has your day been?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cMine has been well, sweetheart.  How has yours been?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cIt\\\\u2019s been good.  I haven\\\\u2019t been home long.  I just got through eating dinner.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cThat\\\\u2019s good.  I had classes today.  I just got through eating some chicken casserole, breadsticks and salad for dinner.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cThat sounds good,\\\\u201d Jim said.\\\\n\\\\n Then Candi said, \\\\u201cJim, I was on Mint Street earlier.  I saw you and Paulina having a good time washing cars at Gilmore Auto Sales.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cYes, we did.  Then again, we always enjoy our job.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cI\\\\u2019m glad you do.  I am glad to see you and Paulina and Pam get along really well.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nThen, Jim heard that song he was listening to earlier at Gilmore Auto Sales.  He said, \\\\u201cCandi, I want you to listen to something on the radio.  A song I heard earlier.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Jim put the phone up to the radio speaker so Candi could hear the song.  He left it there for about three minutes.  Then Jim said to her, \\\\u201cThat song made me think of you.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cJim, that is so beautiful.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cJust like you, sweetie.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cJim, you are so sweet.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Jim and Candi spoke to each other for about five more minutes.  Candi told Jim about college.  She told him about her classes and how she was doing.  She was now taking courses in math and science.  Candi was anxious to get started on studying nursing.  Jim told Candi about school and how he was doing.  Considering this was Jim\\\\u2019s first year of high school and he was dealing with some more challenging courses, he was doing well.  On his last report card, Jim made five A\\\\u2019s and one B.  Jim made a few more friends, but he hung out mostly with those in the neighborhood.  They were very understanding to one another.\\\\n\\\\n Jim also told Candi about English class.  He wrote some poems in that class, and he read some of them to Candi.  She was extremely impressed.\\\\n\\\\n Not once during that phone call did Jim mention the phone call from the girl who said she knew him.  Right now, he decided to just let it drop.\\\\n\\\\n Jim and Candi ended the phone call.  They said \\\\u201cI love you\\\\u201d to one another.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ud83d\\\\ude0a\\\\n\\\\nThat Wednesday saw school let out for the holiday break.  The day went by quickly.  After school, Jim went straight home.  When he got home, Wendy was there, waiting on him.  Jim offered to make a pizza for dinner.  Wendy accepted.  Jim took out a box of pizza crust mix, a jar of pizza sauce, pepperoni, a jar of mushrooms, some mozzarella and cheddar cheese, and he sliced a green pepper.  Jim baked the pizza for a few minutes.  It turned out really good.  It was the first time Jim had made a pizza from scratch.  He thought he did a good job.  Wendy agreed.  Jim liked to cook and was always happy to do it when he wanted to.\\\\n\\\\n On Friday afternoon, Wendy asked Jim to go with her to do some last-minute Christmas shopping.  Jim agreed to join her.  He wanted to get something for Candi, and for his friends.  They wanted to get everything done this evening.\\\\n\\\\n Wendy drove to the Park Road Shopping Center.  At the time, there was a J.C. Penney store there, along with a Woolworth.  Jim and Wendy went to both stores.  Jim had already got various three-dollar gifts for all the girls except Candi.  Jim still needed to get gifts for the guys.  Jim chose Hot Wheels cars for the guys (in turn, Jim usually got Hot Wheels cars from the guys, so he felt it was the least he could do).  Jim got the guys three cars each because he did not want them to feel short-changed since he got gifts for the girls at three dollars each (each car was about a dollar each).  He got those at Woolworth.\\\\n\\\\n Then Jim went to J.C. Penney.  He still had to find something for Candi.  Jim found a cute teddy bear with a heart on it.  The bear itself was orange.  Candi loved teddy bears so he felt this was something she would like and would make her think of him.  Jim saw he had more than enough money to get it, so he did.  Wendy told Jim not to get her anything, but he did anyway.  He got her a small box of chocolates.  He got that at Eckerd\\\\u2019s, which was also in the Park Road Shopping Center, just a short walk from J.C. Penney.\\\\n\\\\n Jim met Wendy in the parking lot.  After they put their stuff in the car, Wendy drove to a nearby McDonald\\\\u2019s.  Jim ate a Big Mac and Wendy had a fish sandwich.  They split a large order of fries, and both drank Coke.  Jim asked Wendy how her recent doctor\\\\u2019s appointment went.  Wendy said, \\\\u201cOh, it was nothing.  I have had some stomach trouble lately, but the doctor gave me some medicine for it.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cI hope there\\\\u2019s no bug going around,\\\\u201d Jim said.\\\\n\\\\n Jim knew Wendy had been throwing up quite a bit, especially in the mornings.  In his own mind, Jim was dismissing the possibility that Wendy was pregnant.  Jim said, \\\\u201cMom, whatever it is, I hope it\\\\u2019s nothing serious.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Wendy said, \\\\u201cJim, it\\\\u2019s nothing for you to worry about.  Nothing life-threatening, and nothing earth shattering.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cOkay, Mom.  If you say so.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cMom, I don\\\\u2019t know who this fellow is you have been dating.  But I hope you\\\\u2019re not letting him take advantage of you.  Don\\\\u2019t let temptation get the better of you.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Wendy looked at Jim for about a minute, and then she said, \\\\u201cJim, of course not.  We\\\\u2019re just friends and nothing more.  We do spend some time at his house.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Wendy usually drove her car to the guy\\\\u2019s house.  After the date, she usually drove herself back to the house.  Jim did want to ask his mother what she and the guy did on their dates, but he didn\\\\u2019t.  If Wendy said there was nothing serious between her and her date, then so be it.  Jim usually told Wendy what he and Candi did on their dates, and when they spent time together.  Wendy trusted Jim a lot, and she was usually understanding.  Wendy knew Jim and Candi had every intention of saving themselves for marriage.  Wendy seemed very pleased about that.  She never wanted to see Jim get hurt.  And she never wanted to see Jim do anything that would hurt him in any way.  She knew he had dreams and ambitions, and she wanted to see him reach them.\\\\n\\\\n Wendy and Jim started for home.  Jim made a request.  \\\\u201cMom, would it be possible to drive past Gilmore Auto Sales?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cSure, Jim.  I suppose that\\\\u2019s a can do.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cPam decked the place out with Christmas lights and I want to see them.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Wendy drove on some side streets until she finally reached Mint Street.  She drove rather slowly on Mint Street, and then she reached Gilmore Auto Sales.  Sure enough, the place was lit up.  There were lights in almost every color of the rainbow.  Jim and Wendy both thought it was pretty, a sight to make one\\\\u2019s spirits tingle!  Jim thought Pam and Paulina did a pretty good job.  Jim was not working when they hung up the lights.\\\\n\\\\n Jim and Wendy arrived home.  Jim and Wendy spent the better part of two hours wrapping the presents they bought.  After they got done, the phone rang.  Whoever was calling must have timed that right.  Jim answered the phone.  He figured that girl must be the one calling.  It turned out it wasn\\\\u2019t.  Pam was on the other end.  She said, \\\\u201cHi, Jim.  I understand you and your mother went past the car lot this evening.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Jim said, \\\\u201cYes, Pam.  As a matter of fact, we did.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cDid you and your mother get your Christmas shopping done?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cYes, Pam.  We did.  We were on our way home from Park Road Shopping Center when we decided to go past the place.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Pam asked Jim, \\\\u201cWhat did you two think?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Jim answered, \\\\u201cPam, you and Paulina did great.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cThanks, Jim.  And there\\\\u2019s another reason why I\\\\u2019m calling.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cSure, Pam.  What is it?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Pam said, \\\\u201cJim, if you wouldn\\\\u2019t mind, please come in about an hour early in the morning.  There\\\\u2019s something I would like you and Paulina to do for me.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cOkay, Pam.  I can come in at eight.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Then Pam said, \\\\u201cI\\\\u2019ll tell you two what it is when you get here in the morning.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cOkay, Pam.  I\\\\u2019ll see you and Paulina tomorrow morning at eight.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ud83d\\\\ude0a\\\\n\\\\nJim went to bed around nine.  He had to be up at around seven the next morning so he could be at Gilmore Auto Sales at eight.  Whatever Pam wanted Jim and Paulina to do, it must have been important.  Jim enjoyed working for Pam, so he was only too happy to come in early if he needed to.  Maybe Pam wanted to get in some big sales before the Christmas holiday. \\\\n\\\\nThe next morning, Jim got up a few minutes before seven.  He got a shower and fixed himself a breakfast of toast, yogurt and Coke.  Wendy soon woke up and joined Jim in the kitchen.  Wendy fixed her some toast and a cup of coffee.  After Wendy ate breakfast, she went upstairs to get dressed.  After Wendy got upstairs, the doorbell rang.  Jim answered it.  Pam and Paulina showed up.  Jim took Pam and Paulina into the kitchen.  Jim fixed Pam a cup of coffee and Paulina a cup of Coke.  Jim also made both of them some toast.  Wendy soon showed up in the kitchen.  Wendy asked Pam and Paulina why they were there, and Pam said, \\\\u201cWendy, I called Jim last night and told him to come in at eight this morning.  I have something important I need him and Paulina to do.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cI guess it\\\\u2019s okay with me.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cOkay, then.  I guess we best get going.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Jim, Pam and Paulina left the house and headed for Gilmore Auto Sales.  On the way, Paulina asked Jim, \\\\u201cWhat did you and your mother think of those Christmas lights?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cThey looked pretty.  I told Mom to drive by the car lot after we got our Christmas shopping done last night.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cWhere did you two go last night?\\\\u201d Paulina asked.\\\\n\\\\n Jim answered, \\\\u201cPark Road Shopping Center.  We went to Eckerd\\\\u2019s, J.C. Penney and Woolworth.  Then we ate at McDonald\\\\u2019s.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cSounds good.  What did you have?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cI had a Big Mac and fries.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Then Pam asked Jim, \\\\u201cHave you heard from that girl lately?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Jim answered, \\\\u201cNo, I haven\\\\u2019t.  But I guess I\\\\u2019ll be hearing from her soon. I do have questions and I really do need some answers.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nPam said, \\\\u201cYes, Jim. That\\\\u2019s about the only way you are going to find out anything you need to know about her.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nJim would soon find out about her. Not only would his questions be answered, he would also find out a lot more about her.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ud83d\\\\ude0a\\\\n\\\\nThey arrived at Gilmore Auto Sales.  Jim saw there were a few more cars than there were Thursday when he last worked.  He also noticed some different ones. \\\\n\\\\nPam soon told Jim and Paulina what she needed done.  \\\\u201cJim and Paulina, I know you two are wondering why you two are here early.  I got some different automobiles.  I need the marquee on the sign changed and I know you are the two who can do just that.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nPam took Jim and Paulina to the storage building behind the office.  In addition to the two wagons used to carry the stuff to clean the cars, Pam had another wagon.  This wagon carried flexible panels for the marquee.  Pam had everything arranged so that the number and letter panels could not be mixed up.  In addition, there were some dollar signs and exclamation marks, and even some smiley faces and special holiday symbols. \\\\n\\\\nPam had Jim pull the wagon to the front of the office.  Jim and Paulina joined Pam in the office.  Pam took two pieces of paper from the desk.  Pam said to them, \\\\u201cJim and Paulina, I need to change the sign outside.  On these two pieces of paper is what I was the sign to say.  One for each side.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nJim and Paulina saw what the pieces of paper said.  On one of them:\\\\n\\\\nHAPPY HOLIDAYS!\\\\n\\\\n1979 PONTIAC TRANS AM\\\\n\\\\nLOW MILES!  $3295\\\\n\\\\nAnd on the other piece of paper:\\\\n\\\\nSEASON\\\\u2019S GREETINGS!\\\\n\\\\n1981 CADILLAC SEVILLE\\\\n\\\\nLOADED!  $4895\\\\n\\\\nPam said, \\\\u201cOkay.  That\\\\u2019s what I want the signs to say.  One for each side.  It doesn\\\\u2019t matter which one you put on what side.  Just get it done.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nJim and Paulina stepped outside.  There were two signs on one side of the lot.  One sign had \\\\u201cGilmore Auto Sales\\\\u201d made out in different colors.  On the bottom of that same sign, the logo for Coke.  Another sign was a marquee.  It had three rows on each side.  Pam used the marquee to advertise automobiles for sale. \\\\n\\\\nPam stepped outside behind Jim and Paulina.  They went back to the storage building.  Jim took, at Pam\\\\u2019s direction, a tall ladder.  Then Pam went back into the office while Jim and Paulina got busy changing the marquee sign.  Jim agreed to use the ladder and change the panels.  Paulina would hand Jim the panels as he needed them.  Jim and Paulina made the decision on which car would be advertised on what side.  They started on the side facing Dilworth.  This side would advertise the Pontiac Trans Am.\\\\n\\\\n Jim climbed up on the ladder.  Paulina watched him on the ground.  Paulina handed Jim panels as he asked for them.  Paulina would tell Jim how to put to each panel in.  She would also tell Jim how far apart to make each word.  Jim started with the top row, the one that would say \\\\u201cHappy Holidays.\\\\u201d  Paulina thought Jim did a good job and caught on quickly.  Now it was on to the second row, the one that would advertise the Pontiac.  Before they could finish that line, there was a blast of a car horn.  It came from a car passing the car lot, going toward uptown.  Jim and Paulina turned toward the passing car.  It was a Mustang, light blue in color.  Jim and Paulina figured it to be about a 1967 model.  There were three people in the car.  They all waved to Jim and Paulina, and they shouted, \\\\u201cHi there, you two!\\\\u201d  Jim and Paulina both waved back.  One of those people, a teenage girl, stuck her head out the window as she waved.  Jim asked Paulina, \\\\u201cDo we know those people?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Pam stepped outside as Paulina answered, \\\\u201cNo, Jim.  I don\\\\u2019t think so.  They don\\\\u2019t look familiar to me.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Jim said, \\\\u201cI don\\\\u2019t know them, either.  They don\\\\u2019t look familiar to me.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Paulina asked, \\\\u201cMom, have we sold a Mustang lately, about a 1967 model?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cNo, I don\\\\u2019t think so.  The last Mustang I sold was about five weeks ago, a 1972.  And we still have that 1976 Mustang.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Pam got a look at the marquee and said, \\\\u201cNice job so far, you two.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Pam turned around and started back for the office.  About halfway, she stopped and turned around and asked Jim and Paulina, \\\\u201cDid you two know those folks in that Mustang that just passed by?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Jim said, \\\\u201cNo, Pam.  We don\\\\u2019t think so.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Then Paulina said, \\\\u201cThey didn\\\\u2019t look familiar to us.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Pam headed back to the office, and Jim and Paulina went back to work.  They finished that one side.  Then they went to the other side, facing uptown.  This side would advertise the Cadillac Seville.  Once again, Jim did a good job.  Just as they got through, Pam opened the car lot. \\\\n\\\\n It seemed to be a good day at Gilmore Auto Sales.  Pam asked Jim to help sell the cars.  During the four-hour working period, they managed to sell four cars.  The Pontiac and the Cadillac were not sold.  Jim and Paulina were hoping whoever was driving that Mustang would drive by the place.  They wanted to get a good look at them.  That did not happen.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ud83d\\\\ude0a\\\\n\\\\nA little after one, Pam closed the car lot.  Just as she did, Wendy drove into the lot to pick up Jim.  Audrey and Julie were with her. \\\\n\\\\nWendy drove to the Eckerd Drug Store at the corner of Trade and Tryon Streets.  Wendy parked on the side of Tryon Street.  Jim wanted to go into Eckerd\\\\u2019s with Wendy and Audrey, but Julie grabbed Jim by his arm, and she said, \\\\u201cJim, please come with me to the record store.  There\\\\u2019s something we need to check out.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nJim and Julie walked to a record store just a few stores past Eckerd\\\\u2019s.  On the way to the record store, they heard an oldies song coming from a nearby car.  The Coasters.  *That Charlie Brown\\\\u2026he\\\\u2019s gonna get caught!*  Jim asked Julie, \\\\u201cWhy are we going to the record store?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nJulie answered, \\\\u201cThere\\\\u2019s a new record I need to try and find.  I heard the song on the radio yesterday and it sounded good.  I just need someone to go in with me.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Jim and Julie stepped into the record store.  A song was playing.  It was from a group by the name of DeBarge.  *You Wear It Well*.  As soon as Julie heard it, she said, \\\\u201cThat\\\\u2019s it, Jim.  That\\\\u2019s the song.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cJulie, I know what you mean.  That sounds like a good song.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Jim and Julie both found a record of that song.  Just as they did, two girls walked to where Jim and Julie were.  One of those girls said, \\\\u201cHi, Julie.  How\\\\u2019s it going?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Julie knew the girls from school.  She said to them, \\\\u201cHi, girls.  It\\\\u2019s going okay.  I found that song I was looking for.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n One of those girls asked, \\\\u201cJulie, who\\\\u2019s your cute friend there?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Julie answered, \\\\u201cA friend of mine.  Jim Faulkner.  We live next to each other.  He works at that used car lot on Mint Street.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n The two girls said together, \\\\u201cHi, gorgeous!\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Jim waved at them.  Then Julie said, \\\\u201cGirls, bad news.  He\\\\u2019s spoken for.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n And with that, the girls left.  Julie said, \\\\u201cDon\\\\u2019t worry, Jim.  Just some girls I know from school.  Let\\\\u2019s pay for our records and let\\\\u2019s head back to Eckerd\\\\u2019s to meet our mothers.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n After Jim and Julie paid for their records, they headed back to Eckerd\\\\u2019s.  When they got there, Wendy and Audrey were still in the store.  Jim and Julie decided they did not need anything from Eckerd\\\\u2019s, so they went back to Wendy\\\\u2019s Volvo.\\\\n\\\\n On the way back home, Julie said to Jim, \\\\u201cI see Pam finally decided to change the sign.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Jim said, \\\\u201cActually, Paulina and I did that.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cLooks like you two did a very good job,\\\\u201d Audrey said.\\\\n\\\\n Then Jim said, \\\\u201cSomething strange happened.  While Paulina and I were changing the sign, three people passed us in a Mustang, and they waved at us.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cWhat did the Mustang look like?\\\\u201d Julie asked.\\\\n\\\\n Jim answered, \\\\u201cA 1967 Mustang.  Light blue in color.  There were three people in it.  One, who looked like a teenage girl, stuck her head out the window.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Julie looked at Jim strangely, and she said, \\\\u201cThat\\\\u2019s funny.  I don\\\\u2019t know anyone with a car like that.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cJim, do you have any idea what those three looked like?\\\\u201d Wendy asked.\\\\n\\\\n \\\\u201cA man and a woman, both about your age.  And a teenage girl, I\\\\u2019d say around thirteen.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Audrey said, \\\\u201cThose descriptions could fit anyone.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nJim said, \\\\u201cI hope I see them again.  I would like to get a better look at them.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Then Wendy asked, \\\\u201cJim, you don\\\\u2019t think the girl in that Mustang is the one who called you and didn\\\\u2019t tell you who she was?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Jim thought about it for about a minute.  Then he said, \\\\u201cMom, I don\\\\u2019t know.  I guess I didn\\\\u2019t think much about that.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ud83d\\\\ude0a\\\\n\\\\nTuesday of that week was Christmas Eve.  Jim went to work at Gilmore Auto Sales.  Paulina was also working.  Pam kept the car lot closed for the day.  There were also some additions.  Pam asked Wendy, Audrey, Malachi and Julie to work some at the car lot.  Pam needed to clean out the office and she needed some extra help.  Wendy and Audrey took down the Christmas lights since no one would be at the car lot until the following Monday (Pam decided to close the car lot for the Christmas week).  Pam got the younger ones to help her clean out the office.  Jim and Malachi helped Pam dispose of old paperwork and old receipts from past automobile sales that had been piling up and cluttering up the office for some time.  Pam, Jim and Malachi put the old papers in big black Hefty bags.  Paulina and Julie were assigned to dust the office furniture, clean the small microwave oven, clean out the small refrigerator (and put in a fresh box of baking soda), and they cleaned out the restroom and the toilet. \\\\n\\\\n After Jim and Malachi got the old paperwork and trash into the bags, they took them out of the office.  Jim and Malachi got Julie to help them get the big heavy bags out to the curb.  On the way, Jim said, \\\\u201cI wonder if that girl is gonna call again.  And if she does, I hope to find out who she is.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Julie said, \\\\u201cI\\\\u2019m sure she will.  It\\\\u2019s just not right for her to call you and not tell you who she is.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n Then Malachi said, \\\\u201cAnd you just may wanna find out how she knows you and how she found out about you.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n When they got to the curb, they got a look at the Charlotte skyline.  It was barely visible through the fog.  The sky was very cloudy, and there was a chill in the air.  It seemed like this winter was about to be yet another cold one.  Maybe there would be a major winter storm this winter.  But right now, it was not cold enough for snow.  Everyone hoped for snow for Christmas.  The last time it snowed on Christmas in Charlotte was way back in 1947.  That was thirty-eight years ago. \\\\n\\\\n They got the bags to the curb and ready for pickup.  Jim said, \\\\u201cI sure hope she calls again.  Maybe the mystery will be revealed.  I hope to find out who she is.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n What Jim did not know was this.  She would call again.  And he would find out who she was\\\\u2026and a lot more!\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ud83d\\\\ude0a\\\\n\\\\nMonday came.  That morning, Jim went to Eastland Mall, as he planned.  Wendy drove him there.  Charmaine and Jodi went with them.  Jim was ready to meet this girl.  Jim sat at a table in front of Chick-fil-A.  Jodi sat with him.  They both ate a chicken sandwich and drank a cup of Coke.  When the girl called, she asked Jim to meet him around eleven o\\\\u2019 clock.  Jim and Jodi sat and waited.  Eleven o\\\\u2019 clock came.  Nothing.  No sign of her.  Jim and Jodi sat and waited for another hour. A little after noon, Jim and Jodi finally decided to give up and leave Chick-fil-A.  They met Wendy and Charmaine in front of Belk.  Then they went home.  Maybe the girl chose not to show up.  If she did call Jim again, he decided he would not say anything to her about not showing up.\\\\n\\\\n Christmas turned out to be pretty good.  Jim got a new color TV set for his bedroom, along with some die-cast metal cars and some cassette tapes.\\\\n\\\\n As the week progressed, Wendy took Jim to the parking lot of an abandoned department store on Wilkinson Boulevard.  Wendy taught Jim how to drive.  At this point, Jim had a learner\\\\u2019s permit.  Wendy did not limit Jim\\\\u2019s learning to drive to the parking lot of that abandoned department store.  She did let Jim drive some in the neighborhood, and in some other nearby neighborhoods.  Jim eventually got to drive on Charlotte streets.  He did start out rough, but he got better with time.  By the first week of 1986, Jim would do well enough to get a driver\\\\u2019s license.\",\\n            \"send_replies\": true,\\n            \"spoiler\": false,\\n            \"stickied\": false,\\n

Looking to see if there is anyone out there who has a similar background to me and how it has benefited your career, or your insight into what you enjoy the most in our field.\\\\n\\\\nSo I\\\\u2019m 28, on track to graduate in a year with an associate\\\\u2019s in applied science along with the DA certification + expanded functions. However, I currently work as a processor (learning waxing and finishing now) in a dental lab (removables). I love what I do currently and want to learn as much as I can in the lab before being chairside, possibly learning tooth setting before I graduate if I feel confident enough with my waxes and finishes. \\\\n\\\\nI know I don\\\\u2019t want to be in the lab forever\\\\u2014and I\\\\u2019m wondering if any other DAs have experience as a dental tech as well. If so, is there one you prefer over the other? And with the overlap in skills, has it given you any extra leverage in the job market?

It\\'s been a month ever since it had been announced, we were finally able to roam the open world again, and everyone went back to their normal lives. You were supposed to leave your town in order to live with her years earlier, but due to the pandemic, your plans were cancelled, and you were forced to meet her a few years later. You\\'ve gained a considerable amount of weight, the laziness and lack of exercise was the main reason as to why this had happened, but there was another reason, one that would make people judge you if you ever mentioned it to them. You liked big women, the feeling of your clothes tightening and sinking in to your fat while you eat massive amounts of food felt hot to you, you were an insatiable glutton with a desire to eat as much as possible, pushing yourself to your limits every single night in order to gain a few pounds. When it was time for you to move, you panicked, you felt that she might hate you due to your new, pudgy figure, you even thought that she might badmouth you for being such a fatass. After arriving to her city, you couldn\\'t help but notice but feel different, the people around you looked a bit strange, thats when you bumped into another lady, however, she was the same size as you, she had blue sparkly eyes alongside her blonde hair colour, donning a blac dress that was clearly having trouble keeping her fat in. Momentarily, she apologized before walking off, now that you think about it, all of the women around you seem to be rather chubbier than usual, however you didn\\'t mind it at all, brushing it off as some kind of dream. Finally, you were able to arrive to her home, a two story modern house, surrounded by a gate and a garden in front of it. As you walked by the pathway leading to the door, you couldn\\'t help but feel nervous, what if she hates you? What if she doesn\\'t accept you for being such a blubber ball? You shivered, holding your bags tightly as you pressed on the doorbell, and for a few seconds there was silence. It started to feel like forever as you thought to yourself, thinking of what might happen next, you decided that it\\'s best for you to leave, fearing that she may never accept you, as you turn around, the door behind you opened. Turning your head around, you couldn\\'t help but be amazed, she was about the same size as you, the same height too, it was like looking at a mirror. You phased out for a few seconds, before the fat woman called out to your name, welcoming you with a warm welcome, her body fat serving as a furnace of sorts, you couldn\\'t help but wonder. How did she get so big? What happened? And why is it hot? You heard a chuckle, as the womans says in a soft and gentle voice\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Welcome home, sweetie..~\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nHiya! If you\\'re still reading here then, congratulations! This is a basic summary of my plot, it\\'s a post pandemic weight gain roleplay in which you play the character that\\'s moving in to my home! Naturally there\\'s multiple ways that we could play this out, we could either be sisters, friends or even long distance lovers! I\\'ve gotten rather big since our last meeting, and who knows? Yet there\\'s something about me and the place that we\\'re living with in that makes you uneasy, and it\\'s up to you to finding the key to solving this mystery\\\\n\\\\nI wanted to make it so that it\\'s secretive, my character suspects you of having a fat fetish, while your character pretty much feels the same, suspecting me of having the same kink, and it will eventually lead to them discovering each other\\'s fetish, there\\'s multiple plot points that I wanted to incorporate in this story such as different ways of gaining weight, story and so much more!\\\\n\\\\nI expect you to be at least fairly literate, I don\\'t need you to write out a whole book per reply, I just want someone who doesn\\'t do one-liners, its okay if you\\'re a male playing a female! Long as both characters are female then we should be all good! I wanted this roleplay to be semi-realistic too, I just enjoy seeing the detail when the other stuffs themselves with so much food as their belly churns, groaning in pain as it was placed on top of the table\\\\n\\\\nThis will be long-term, so please if possible, no ghosting, I would understand if something is wrong or if you\\'re busy, that\\'s alright since our real lives are more important than just roleplay, but if you\\'re disliking the roleplay as we continue, please tell me instead of ghosting me\\\\n\\\\nWell, that\\'s all that I have for this prompt right now! Other details will be explained in DMs, please don\\'t leave me simple blank hello messages, introduce yourself! So if this catches your eye and interests you? Hit me up! I hope to see you soon! If you\\'ve been reading up to here, please tell me what your favorite color is upon messaging me!\\\\n\\\\nKinks: Weight Gain, Chugging, Mutual Gain, Force Feeding, Stuckage, Burping, Science

But I am curious about other experiences.\\\\n\\\\nI\\'m reading:\\\\n\\\\n**Emotional Neglect and Complex PTSD By Pete Walker** an 11 page paper linked from the Wiki.  He spends a lot of time talking about the belittling and dismissive emotional neglect, and the toxic effects. He also says that lots of kids don\\'t recognize it as abuse. Most of his examples are \\\\\"active measures\\\\\" by the parent, even if active means \\\\\"turning away and ignoring\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nI don\\'t know how to characterize what happened to me.   I never felt that I couldn\\'t go to them and ask for help.  But I didn\\'t want to.  Once I waited until a skinned knee had an infection the size of a quarter and hurting a lot before asking my mom.  (Age 6?  Age 8? Old enough I was bathing myself.)  Shows how much I kept to myself that she didn\\'t notice.  It was summer.  I was in shorts all the time.   Another time I was playing with fire, and spilled burning mineral spirits on my hand, resulting in a big blister on my thumb.  After a few hours of trying to tough it out, I brought it to my dad who promptly lanced the blister, put a burn salve on it, and wrapped it.  This felt much better.  I explained how it happened.  Didn\\'t get in trouble for it.  Asked me how I would keep it from happening again.\\\\n\\\\nBut why was I reluctant to take my owies to my parents? Fear of disapproval?  \\\\n\\\\nI don\\'t remember receiving their disapproval for much of anything.   But I don\\'t remember their approval much either.   I think they were pleased when I won a minor prize in a regional science fair in grade 8, but I don\\'t remember them being there. There was an underlying expectation that someone of my smarts should be bringing home more A\\'s and fewer C\\'s, but there weren\\'t incentives for As or disapproval for C\\'s\\\\n\\\\nBoth parents were chronically sick and didn\\'t have a lot of energy. There was always hot supper. Mom bought me clothes until I was 12 and got a paper route.  My allowance stopped.    I was proud of that.  Meant I had taken a step toward independence. Mom helped me with the paper route book keeping.\\\\n\\\\nSo it wasn\\'t like I was totally neglected.  I played chess with my father.  I had toys and puzzles. I don\\'t remember making envious comparisons to other kids.  Every Tuesday from grade 3 onward was Library night.  I was pretty much illiterate at the end of grade 2.  (Class of 50) So it was a stack of books every week, and after school I would perch on the stool in the kitchen and read out loud to my mom while she was making supper.  I remember Dad reading Winnie the Pooh both of us in a big overstuffed floral print chair (18\\\\\" poppies or peonies).  Snuggled beside him, warm and safe.   \\\\n\\\\nBut I don\\'t remember hugs. I don\\'t remember my parents demonstrating affection for each other.\\\\n\\\\nUsing the list elsewhere in the FAQ, I have a lot of the symptoms (41/56) that correlate with CPTSD, but I don\\'t have anything overt happening.  Now that I\\'m aware of what they are, I sense the odd \\\\\"emo flashback\\\\\"  E.g. this morning, before getting up, I felt fear, but no elevated breathing or pulse.  I wanted to hide.  I thought, \\\\\"I need to hide harder\\\\\"  Odd phrasing that.   Writing about it now, I can trigger that a little bit.  Seems to come with a bit of dissociation.  Have I had these all along, but only with learning about this chaotic illness started to notice?  Or is it that now, since I\\'m trying to dig in, that hidden chunks are saying, \\\\\"He\\'s listening. Boy are we going to give him an earful\\\\\"  If the latter they are still trying to remember how to talk.\\\\n\\\\nBut everything is always so vague.  Mist demons.   Nailing fog to the barn door.  Trying to fix the car engine that almost runs right most of the time.\\\\n\\\\nI \\\\\\\\*really\\\\\\\\* wish that I had an owner\\'s manual.\\\\n\\\\nMy first therapy appointment is Wednesday.  I can hardly wait.\",\\n            \"send_replies\": true,\\n            \"spoiler\": false,\\n            \"stickied\": false,\\n            \"subreddit\": \"CPTSD\",\\n            \"subreddit_id\":

'selftext': 'About two weeks before Christmas, Jim was in his room, watching *Jeopardy!*  Jim heard the phone in the hallway ring.  Wendy answered it.  After about a minute, Wendy shouted, “Jim!  Phone call for you!”\\n\\n Jim got himself up, and he made his way into the hallway.  Jim sat down in the chair beside the table that held the hallway phone.  Jim wondered who would be calling him.  Maybe it was Candi.  Or maybe one of his many friends.  Jim picked up the phone and said, “Hello.  Jim Faulkner speaking.”\\n\\n The voice on the other end said, “Hi, Jim Faulkner.  How are you this evening?”\\n\\n The voice on the other end did not sound familiar to Jim.  That prompted Jim to ask, “May I ask who’s calling?”\\n\\n That voice, which was a girl, said to Jim, “I can’t tell you, but I will tell you that I know you.”\\n\\n “How so?” Jim asked.\\n\\n The girl said, “I know you hang out at Eastland Mall quite a lot.”\\n\\n Jim said, “Yes, I do.  I hang out with my friends.  I have quite a bit of friends.”\\n\\n “I see,” the girl said.\\n\\n “I should have you know I do have a girlfriend and we are going steady.”\\n\\n “Really?  Who is she?”\\n\\n “Her name is Candi Robertson.”\\n\\n “You mean Candice Jade Robertson?  Yeah, I know her.”\\n\\n Once again, Jim asked who the girl was.  She said she could not tell Jim who she is right now, only that she knows him, that he lives on Bethany Street in the Dilworth area of Charlotte, and that he spends some time at Eastland Mall.  Jim had half a mind to ask the girl how she got his phone number.  But he didn’t, because he was quite sure she wouldn’t tell him that, either. \\n\\nThe girl asked Jim if she could meet him at Eastland Mall the Monday after school let out for the holiday break.  He said he probably could, but he didn’t sound like he was sure.  He told the girl he could not promise anything.  Jim thought one thing.  *To make a promise to a bunch of young people to be friends forever may be one thing.  But to make a promise of any kind to someone I don’t even know, especially a girl around my age, that may be something else again.*\\n\\n Jim said to the girl, “I’ll see what I can do.  But I’m not sure I can promise anything.”\\n\\n The girl said, “Okay, Jim.  I’ll be there then.  If you do show up at Eastland Mall, please meet me in front of Chick-fil-A.”\\n\\n Jim said he would try.  And with that, they ended the call.\\n\\n A few minutes later, Wendy stepped into Jim’s bedroom, and she asked him, “Jim, who was that on the phone?  One of your friends?”\\n\\n “No, Mom.  Not exactly.  Some girl who claims she knows me.”\\n\\n “Does she have a name?”\\n\\n “Mom, I asked her.  She said she could not tell me her name.”\\n\\n “Oh, Jim.  That sounds rather rude.”\\n\\n “Rude, maybe.  Weird, probably.”\\n\\n “How did she get our phone number?”\\n\\n Jim thought about how to answer that.  He knew their number was never unlisted.  Wendy did want to have the number unlisted at one point, but she decided against it because she was not sure if she could afford to pay to have it unlisted.  After Wendy decided against it, she never thought of it again.  Finally, Jim answered Wendy’s question by saying, “Mom, I’m not sure.  The girl did say she knew Candi.  But I don’t think Candi would give anyone our phone number, or even her own.”\\n\\n “Okay, Jim.  Did she say anything about wanting to meet you?”\\n\\n “Yes, Mom.  She said she wishes to meet with me at Eastland Mall the Monday after school’s out for the holidays.  She said we could meet at Chick-fil-A.”\\n\\n “Are you planning to meet her?” Wendy asked.\\n\\n Jim answered, “I guess.  She could be a potential friend.”\\n\\n Then Wendy said, “Okay, Jim.  Just be careful, okay?”\\n\\n“Okay, Mom.  You know I am always careful.”\\n\\n Wendy smiled and headed for the bedroom door.  She opened the door.  Before she stepped out, she turned around and said to Jim, “I will be working tomorrow until around two.  But I won’t be coming straight home.  I have a doctor’s appointment and I may be home quite late tomorrow evening.”\\n\\n Jim said, “Sure, Mom.  What kind of appointment?”\\n\\n “I’ve not been feeling well lately.  I’m just going to have Doctor Firestone check me out.  Nothing major, nothing earth-shattering for you to worry about.”\\n\\nJim looked at Wendy and gave her a nod.  After Wendy stepped out of the room, Jim thought, *Nothing to worry about, all right.  The only thing I have to worry about at this point is a girl I don’t know trying to meet me and maybe trying to get me to be her boyfriend.  I have a girlfriend.  Candi.  She’s my one and only*.\\n\\n Just before Jim went to bed, it hit him.  A few months ago, Candi spoke to a girl at Eastland Mall while Jim and Ariel and Jodi were there.  Was there a possibility that could be the girl who called?  Maybe.  Jim would soon find out.\\n\\n😊\\n\\nThe next day, Jim worked some after school at Gilmore Auto Sales.  While Jim was washing a car, he said, “Paulina, I feel like some kind of a freak.”\\n\\n Paulina was washing a car next to the one Jim was washing.  She asked him, “How can you feel like that?”\\n\\n “Some girl who I do not know calls me, does not tell me who she is, and claims she knows quite a bit about me.  That’s weird.  How do you explain that?”\\n\\n “You’re right, Jim.  That is weird.”\\n\\n Jim said, “Then I happened to remember something.  A few months ago, Ariel and Jodi and I were hanging out at Eastland Mall.  That same evening, Candi spoke to a girl at the mall who claimed she knows me.  I wonder if that’s the girl who called me last night.”\\n\\n “Jim, she very well could be,” Paulina said.\\n\\n “She wants to meet me at Eastland Mall the Monday after school’s out for the holiday break.”\\n\\n “Are you planning to meet her?”\\n\\n “I don’t know.  Maybe.  Depends on whether or not I’m at the mall on that day.”\\n\\n Then Paulina said, “Jim, I know a girl at school who had the same thing happen to her.  About a couple months ago, she got a call from some boy.  She met the boy at a Winn-Dixie on East Independence Boulevard.  It turned out the boy was that girl’s brother.  She kept denying it, saying she had always been an only child.”\\n\\n Jim gave Paulina a rather strange look.  Then he said, “Paulina, I can’t believe you told a story like that.  True, I haven’t seen my father in many years.  But I have no brothers or sisters, at least not that I know of.”\\n\\n Paulina gave Jim a serious look and said, “Jim, it could happen.  You just said it yourself.  You haven’t seen your father in years.  A lot can happen.”\\n\\n Jim turned around and looked at the Charlotte skyline, took in a deep breath, let it out slowly, and then he said, “Yeah, Paulina.  I guess you’re right.  Maybe I should meet this girl and see if she truly is my sister.”\\n\\n“My brothers and I haven’t seen our father in about a couple years.  Mom says we may never see him again.  It seems as though Russell and Scout could be all I’ll ever have for brothers, unless there’s a brother or sister out there we don’t know about.”\\n\\n Then Jim said, “My Mom had a doctor’s appointment today.”\\n\\n “Did she say why?” Paulina asked.\\n\\n “She didn’t say.  Maybe a check-up or something.”\\n\\n Paulina said, “Yeah.  Or something.”\\n\\n Then Paulina walked to where Jim was.  Then she said to him, “Jim, I have been looking at Wendy a lot at church.  She seemed a little different.”\\n\\n “How different?” Jim asked.\\n\\n Paulina pointed to her belly.  Then she said, “Jim, her belly looked different.  Is there any possibility she could be…pregnant?”\\n\\n Jim gave Paulina a look and said, “No.  I don’t think so.”\\n\\n Paulina said, “Yeah, sure.  We’ll just drop it.  Forget I asked.”\\n\\n Then Jim said, “Mom has been dating quite a bit.”\\n\\n Paulina said, “Yeah.  So I heard.  Is it serious?”\\n\\n Jim answered, “No, I don’t think so.  Nothing more than casual.  At least, as far as I know.”\\n\\n Then Pam stepped out of the office and walked to where Jim and Paulina were.  Pam walked toward Jim and said, “Jim, I wonder if I could see you inside.”\\n\\n “Sure, Pam.  Something wrong?”\\n\\n “No, Jim.  Nothing bad.  I just need to speak to you for a minute.”\\n\\n Jim walked to where Pam was standing.  Pam said, “Paulina, you just keep washing.  Jim will be back in a moment.”\\n\\n Pam put her arm around Jim while they walked into the office.  Pam told Jim to sit down while she got a couple bottles of Coke.  The stereo in the office was set to a soft rock station.  Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway.  *The Closer I Get to You*.  Jim listened to it for a minute.  He would listen to some music when he got home.  He hoped that song would play sometime during the evening.  Maybe he would call Candi and put the phone to the speaker and play that song for her.  Or better, maybe Candi would visit his house this evening.  If that would be the case, maybe that song would play while she was there.  Pam stepped into the office with the two bottles of Coke. She gave one of those bottles to Jim.  Then Pam stepped to the stereo and got ready to turn the music down.  The song was still playing.  Jim said to her, “No, Pam.  Leave it where it’s at.  That’s a beautiful song.”\\n\\n Pam turned to Jim and said, “Okay, Jim.  If you say so.”\\n\\n Pam got ready to sit down when she said, “You, listening to that song.  I’ll bet you’re thinking about Candi, aren’t you?”\\n\\n“Yes, Pam.  I guess you could say I am.”\\n\\n “I know, Jim.  I’ve also been thinking about someone else.  You.  And your mother.”\\n\\n “How so?”\\n\\n “I understand you got a phone call from a girl last night.”\\n\\n Jim turned around and got a look at Paulina.  She was now washing another car.  Then Jim said, “Word sure does get around.”\\n\\n “It does,” Pam said.\\n\\n Then Jim asked Pam, “Where did you hear that?”\\n\\n Pam answered, “I spoke to your mother this morning.”\\n\\n Then Jim told Pam about the details about the phone call.  He said, “Some girl who I don’t know but who claims she knows me calls me, won’t tell me who she is or how she got my number, and who wants to meet me after school’s out for the holidays.  Does that just about cover it?”\\n\\n Then Pam asked Jim, “Doesn’t that strike you as a little strange?”\\n\\n Jim answered, “I suppose it does.”\\n\\n “I know it does.  Especially if she does not tell you who she is or why she wants to have any communication with you.”\\n\\n “I hope she does call again because I wish to find out who she is and how she knows me.”\\n\\n Then Pam shifted to another subject.  “Jim, is your mother okay?”\\n\\n “She is.  Why would you ask?”\\n\\n “I’ve seen her in church.  And I know she’s dating someone.”\\n\\n Jim said, “I know she is.  She doesn’t bring him by the house.  I haven’t met him.  I don’t think it’s anything serious.  Sometimes she doesn’t get home until quite late.  Then again, I do keep some weird hours between studying and working here.  Maybe I’m out of the house quite a bit.”\\n\\n “Yes, Jim.  And you are doing a good job.  Both at school and for me.”\\n\\n “Thanks, Pam.”\\n\\n “Jim, is it just me or has your mother gained a bit of weight?”\\n\\n “Mom does eat enough to feed a mule.  I must admit I do, too.  Maybe she has gained a little weight.”\\n\\n Pam began to ask if Wendy was pregnant.  But she didn’t ask.  Instead, she said, “Okay, Jim.  Don’t say anything about that to her.  We won’t hurt her feelings.  Just forget I asked.”\\n\\n “Yeah, Pam.  Sure.”\\n\\n Pam excused Jim to continue washing cars.  He got ready to finish the car he was working on.  Paulina was playing a radio at the car she was working on.  The radio was set to an oldies station, playing Andy Williams.  *On the Street Where You Live*.  Jim thought it was a nice song.  It made him think not only of Candi, but of Bethany Street, and the neighborhood.  It made him think of his mother, his friends, and their parents.  And of Gilmore Auto Sales.  And of Charlotte, North Carolina. \\n\\n Paulina asked, “What did you and my mother talk about?”\\n\\n Jim answered, “Not much.  Just about what you and I talked about a while ago.  About that phone call, that girl, and Mom.”\\n\\n “Oh, I see.”\\n\\n Then Jim got a look at the car Paulina was washing.  It was rather big.  It was white with a red interior and had roof panels.  “What kind of car is that?” Jim asked.\\n\\n “Mom just got it yesterday.  It’s an Oldsmobile Toronado.  Mom said it’s a 1978 model.”\\n\\n “It’s big but it looks nice.”\\n\\n Then Paulina pointed to two other cars and said, “Mom also got that blue Cadillac and gray Mustang.  Both are 1976.”\\n\\n “Who brought them?” Jim asked.\\n\\n Paulina answered, “Some automobile wholesale guy in Charlotte who said he was retiring and had three cars left.  He needed to get rid of them and told Mom she could have them to sell.”\\n\\n That was when they heard the blast of a car horn.  Jim and Paulina both turned to face Mint Street.  They saw a big gray Dodge with a red roof pass the car lot.  Hands waved out of the windows.  Then Jim and Paulina saw who they were.  Mark and Alex were in the front seat.  And in the back seat, Simon, Sydney and Candi.  And driving the car, their mother, Autumn Cavanaugh (Autumn was now driving a late seventies model Dodge).  They also shouted “Hi” to Jim and Paulina.  Autumn was driving toward uptown.\\n\\n Jim and Paulina kept at it for another hour, washing automobile after automobile.  Finally, at around seven, Pam turned off the lights and closed the car lot. \\n\\nPam offered to drive Jim home.  He happily accepted.  When Jim got home, the lights were still on, including the porch light.  Pam watched Jim go inside.  Wendy stepped outside and waved at Pam and Paulina.  They waved back. \\n\\n When Jim got inside, he saw his dinner plate on the table.  On it, hamburger steak with Heinz 57, fries with ketchup, salad with blue cheese dressing, onion rings, a bread roll, and a glass of iced tea.  As Jim ate, Wendy asked him how his day went.  He said, “It went pretty good.  Paulina and Pam both asked me about that phone call I got last night.”\\n\\n “I see.  I’ll bet they found that pretty strange also,” Wendy said.\\n\\n“Yes, Mom.  They did.”\\n\\n “Jim, did Pam and Paulina ask anything about me?”\\n\\n “What do you mean, Mom?”\\n\\n “I know they have been looking at me and so has everybody else.”\\n\\n “They did ask about you.  I promised them I wouldn’t say anything to you because they felt it may hurt your feelings.”\\n\\n “Jim, just come out with it.  If it does hurt my feelings, no one will know.”\\n\\n Jim said, “They wondered if you were pregnant.”\\n\\n Wendy said, “I only told Pam I had a doctor’s appointment.  That’s all.”\\n\\n “It’s okay, Mom.  I told them that I didn’t think you were.  They knew you were dating.  I knew it wasn’t anything more than that.”\\n\\n And with that, the subject was dropped.  Jim told her dinner was good.  He washed up the dishes, and then he went upstairs to his room.\\n\\n😊\\n\\nJim went to his room to see a car magazine on his bed.  It was a *Road and Track*, and it had three racing cars from the United Kingdom on the cover, a Ferrari and a Jaguar and a Porsche.  Some evenings, Jim would watch TV in his room.  But he decided he would just listen to some music and read his magazine since there was nothing good on TV this evening. \\n\\n Jim lied down on his bed and read his magazine.  About a half an hour into his magazine, the phone rang.  Jim figured it was for Wendy.  Wendy answered the phone.  Then she shouted from downstairs, “Jim!  Phone for you!  It’s Candi!”\\n\\n Jim walked into the hallway and grabbed the cordless phone from the small hallway table.  He took the phone and went back to his room.  He said, “Hi, Candi.  How has your day been?”\\n\\n “Mine has been well, sweetheart.  How has yours been?”\\n\\n “It’s been good.  I haven’t been home long.  I just got through eating dinner.”\\n\\n “That’s good.  I had classes today.  I just got through eating some chicken casserole, breadsticks and salad for dinner.”\\n\\n “That sounds good,” Jim said.\\n\\n Then Candi said, “Jim, I was on Mint Street earlier.  I saw you and Paulina having a good time washing cars at Gilmore Auto Sales.”\\n\\n “Yes, we did.  Then again, we always enjoy our job.”\\n\\n “I’m glad you do.  I am glad to see you and Paulina and Pam get along really well.”\\n\\nThen, Jim heard that song he was listening to earlier at Gilmore Auto Sales.  He said, “Candi, I want you to listen to something on the radio.  A song I heard earlier.”\\n\\n Jim put the phone up to the radio speaker so Candi could hear the song.  He left it there for about three minutes.  Then Jim said to her, “That song made me think of you.”\\n\\n “Jim, that is so beautiful.”\\n\\n “Just like you, sweetie.”\\n\\n “Jim, you are so sweet.”\\n\\n Jim and Candi spoke to each other for about five more minutes.  Candi told Jim about college.  She told him about her classes and how she was doing.  She was now taking courses in math and science.  Candi was anxious to get started on studying nursing.  Jim told Candi about school and how he was doing.  Considering this was Jim’s first year of high school and he was dealing with some more challenging courses, he was doing well.  On his last report card, Jim made five A’s and one B.  Jim made a few more friends, but he hung out mostly with those in the neighborhood.  They were very understanding to one another.\\n\\n Jim also told Candi about English class.  He wrote some poems in that class, and he read some of them to Candi.  She was extremely impressed.\\n\\n Not once during that phone call did Jim mention the phone call from the girl who said she knew him.  Right now, he decided to just let it drop.\\n\\n Jim and Candi ended the phone call.  They said “I love you” to one another.\\n\\n😊\\n\\nThat Wednesday saw school let out for the holiday break.  The day went by quickly.  After school, Jim went straight home.  When he got home, Wendy was there, waiting on him.  Jim offered to make a pizza for dinner.  Wendy accepted.  Jim took out a box of pizza crust mix, a jar of pizza sauce, pepperoni, a jar of mushrooms, some mozzarella and cheddar cheese, and he sliced a green pepper.  Jim baked the pizza for a few minutes.  It turned out really good.  It was the first time Jim had made a pizza from scratch.  He thought he did a good job.  Wendy agreed.  Jim liked to cook and was always happy to do it when he wanted to.\\n\\n On Friday afternoon, Wendy asked Jim to go with her to do some last-minute Christmas shopping.  Jim agreed to join her.  He wanted to get something for Candi, and for his friends.  They wanted to get everything done this evening.\\n\\n Wendy drove to the Park Road Shopping Center.  At the time, there was a J.C. Penney store there, along with a Woolworth.  Jim and Wendy went to both stores.  Jim had already got various three-dollar gifts for all the girls except Candi.  Jim still needed to get gifts for the guys.  Jim chose Hot Wheels cars for the guys (in turn, Jim usually got Hot Wheels cars from the guys, so he felt it was the least he could do).  Jim got the guys three cars each because he did not want them to feel short-changed since he got gifts for the girls at three dollars each (each car was about a dollar each).  He got those at Woolworth.\\n\\n Then Jim went to J.C. Penney.  He still had to find something for Candi.  Jim found a cute teddy bear with a heart on it.  The bear itself was orange.  Candi loved teddy bears so he felt this was something she would like and would make her think of him.  Jim saw he had more than enough money to get it, so he did.  Wendy told Jim not to get her anything, but he did anyway.  He got her a small box of chocolates.  He got that at Eckerd’s, which was also in the Park Road Shopping Center, just a short walk from J.C. Penney.\\n\\n Jim met Wendy in the parking lot.  After they put their stuff in the car, Wendy drove to a nearby McDonald’s.  Jim ate a Big Mac and Wendy had a fish sandwich.  They split a large order of fries, and both drank Coke.  Jim asked Wendy how her recent doctor’s appointment went.  Wendy said, “Oh, it was nothing.  I have had some stomach trouble lately, but the doctor gave me some medicine for it.”\\n\\n “I hope there’s no bug going around,” Jim said.\\n\\n Jim knew Wendy had been throwing up quite a bit, especially in the mornings.  In his own mind, Jim was dismissing the possibility that Wendy was pregnant.  Jim said, “Mom, whatever it is, I hope it’s nothing serious.”\\n\\n Wendy said, “Jim, it’s nothing for you to worry about.  Nothing life-threatening, and nothing earth shattering.”\\n\\n “Okay, Mom.  If you say so.”\\n\\n “Mom, I don’t know who this fellow is you have been dating.  But I hope you’re not letting him take advantage of you.  Don’t let temptation get the better of you.”\\n\\n Wendy looked at Jim for about a minute, and then she said, “Jim, of course not.  We’re just friends and nothing more.  We do spend some time at his house.”\\n\\n Wendy usually drove her car to the guy’s house.  After the date, she usually drove herself back to the house.  Jim did want to ask his mother what she and the guy did on their dates, but he didn’t.  If Wendy said there was nothing serious between her and her date, then so be it.  Jim usually told Wendy what he and Candi did on their dates, and when they spent time together.  Wendy trusted Jim a lot, and she was usually understanding.  Wendy knew Jim and Candi had every intention of saving themselves for marriage.  Wendy seemed very pleased about that.  She never wanted to see Jim get hurt.  And she never wanted to see Jim do anything that would hurt him in any way.  She knew he had dreams and ambitions, and she wanted to see him reach them.\\n\\n Wendy and Jim started for home.  Jim made a request.  “Mom, would it be possible to drive past Gilmore Auto Sales?”\\n\\n “Sure, Jim.  I suppose that’s a can do.”\\n\\n “Pam decked the place out with Christmas lights and I want to see them.”\\n\\n Wendy drove on some side streets until she finally reached Mint Street.  She drove rather slowly on Mint Street, and then she reached Gilmore Auto Sales.  Sure enough, the place was lit up.  There were lights in almost every color of the rainbow.  Jim and Wendy both thought it was pretty, a sight to make one’s spirits tingle!  Jim thought Pam and Paulina did a pretty good job.  Jim was not working when they hung up the lights.\\n\\n Jim and Wendy arrived home.  Jim and Wendy spent the better part of two hours wrapping the presents they bought.  After they got done, the phone rang.  Whoever was calling must have timed that right.  Jim answered the phone.  He figured that girl must be the one calling.  It turned out it wasn’t.  Pam was on the other end.  She said, “Hi, Jim.  I understand you and your mother went past the car lot this evening.”\\n\\n Jim said, “Yes, Pam.  As a matter of fact, we did.”\\n\\n “Did you and your mother get your Christmas shopping done?”\\n\\n “Yes, Pam.  We did.  We were on our way home from Park Road Shopping Center when we decided to go past the place.”\\n\\n Pam asked Jim, “What did you two think?”\\n\\n Jim answered, “Pam, you and Paulina did great.”\\n\\n “Thanks, Jim.  And there’s another reason why I’m calling.”\\n\\n “Sure, Pam.  What is it?”\\n\\n Pam said, “Jim, if you wouldn’t mind, please come in about an hour early in the morning.  There’s something I would like you and Paulina to do for me.”\\n\\n “Okay, Pam.  I can come in at eight.”\\n\\n Then Pam said, “I’ll tell you two what it is when you get here in the morning.”\\n\\n “Okay, Pam.  I’ll see you and Paulina tomorrow morning at eight.”\\n\\n😊\\n\\nJim went to bed around nine.  He had to be up at around seven the next morning so he could be at Gilmore Auto Sales at eight.  Whatever Pam wanted Jim and Paulina to do, it must have been important.  Jim enjoyed working for Pam, so he was only too happy to come in early if he needed to.  Maybe Pam wanted to get in some big sales before the Christmas holiday. \\n\\nThe next morning, Jim got up a few minutes before seven.  He got a shower and fixed himself a breakfast of toast, yogurt and Coke.  Wendy soon woke up and joined Jim in the kitchen.  Wendy fixed her some toast and a cup of coffee.  After Wendy ate breakfast, she went upstairs to get dressed.  After Wendy got upstairs, the doorbell rang.  Jim answered it.  Pam and Paulina showed up.  Jim took Pam and Paulina into the kitchen.  Jim fixed Pam a cup of coffee and Paulina a cup of Coke.  Jim also made both of them some toast.  Wendy soon showed up in the kitchen.  Wendy asked Pam and Paulina why they were there, and Pam said, “Wendy, I called Jim last night and told him to come in at eight this morning.  I have something important I need him and Paulina to do.”\\n\\n “I guess it’s okay with me.”\\n\\n “Okay, then.  I guess we best get going.”\\n\\n Jim, Pam and Paulina left the house and headed for Gilmore Auto Sales.  On the way, Paulina asked Jim, “What did you and your mother think of those Christmas lights?”\\n\\n “They looked pretty.  I told Mom to drive by the car lot after we got our Christmas shopping done last night.”\\n\\n “Where did you two go last night?” Paulina asked.\\n\\n Jim answered, “Park Road Shopping Center.  We went to Eckerd’s, J.C. Penney and Woolworth.  Then we ate at McDonald’s.”\\n\\n “Sounds good.  What did you have?”\\n\\n “I had a Big Mac and fries.”\\n\\n Then Pam asked Jim, “Have you heard from that girl lately?”\\n\\n Jim answered, “No, I haven’t.  But I guess I’ll be hearing from her soon. I do have questions and I really do need some answers.”\\n\\nPam said, “Yes, Jim. That’s about the only way you are going to find out anything you need to know about her.”\\n\\nJim would soon find out about her. Not only would his questions be answered, he would also find out a lot more about her.\\n\\n😊\\n\\nThey arrived at Gilmore Auto Sales.  Jim saw there were a few more cars than there were Thursday when he last worked.  He also noticed some different ones. \\n\\nPam soon told Jim and Paulina what she needed done.  “Jim and Paulina, I know you two are wondering why you two are here early.  I got some different automobiles.  I need the marquee on the sign changed and I know you are the two who can do just that.”\\n\\nPam took Jim and Paulina to the storage building behind the office.  In addition to the two wagons used to carry the stuff to clean the cars, Pam had another wagon.  This wagon carried flexible panels for the marquee.  Pam had everything arranged so that the number and letter panels could not be mixed up.  In addition, there were some dollar signs and exclamation marks, and even some smiley faces and special holiday symbols. \\n\\nPam had Jim pull the wagon to the front of the office.  Jim and Paulina joined Pam in the office.  Pam took two pieces of paper from the desk.  Pam said to them, “Jim and Paulina, I need to change the sign outside.  On these two pieces of paper is what I was the sign to say.  One for each side.”\\n\\nJim and Paulina saw what the pieces of paper said.  On one of them:\\n\\nHAPPY HOLIDAYS!\\n\\n1979 PONTIAC TRANS AM\\n\\nLOW MILES!  $3295\\n\\nAnd on the other piece of paper:\\n\\nSEASON’S GREETINGS!\\n\\n1981 CADILLAC SEVILLE\\n\\nLOADED!  $4895\\n\\nPam said, “Okay.  That’s what I want the signs to say.  One for each side.  It doesn’t matter which one you put on what side.  Just get it done.”\\n\\nJim and Paulina stepped outside.  There were two signs on one side of the lot.  One sign had “Gilmore Auto Sales” made out in different colors.  On the bottom of that same sign, the logo for Coke.  Another sign was a marquee.  It had three rows on each side.  Pam used the marquee to advertise automobiles for sale. \\n\\nPam stepped outside behind Jim and Paulina.  They went back to the storage building.  Jim took, at Pam’s direction, a tall ladder.  Then Pam went back into the office while Jim and Paulina got busy changing the marquee sign.  Jim agreed to use the ladder and change the panels.  Paulina would hand Jim the panels as he needed them.  Jim and Paulina made the decision on which car would be advertised on what side.  They started on the side facing Dilworth.  This side would advertise the Pontiac Trans Am.\\n\\n Jim climbed up on the ladder.  Paulina watched him on the ground.  Paulina handed Jim panels as he asked for them.  Paulina would tell Jim how to put to each panel in.  She would also tell Jim how far apart to make each word.  Jim started with the top row, the one that would say “Happy Holidays.”  Paulina thought Jim did a good job and caught on quickly.  Now it was on to the second row, the one that would advertise the Pontiac.  Before they could finish that line, there was a blast of a car horn.  It came from a car passing the car lot, going toward uptown.  Jim and Paulina turned toward the passing car.  It was a Mustang, light blue in color.  Jim and Paulina figured it to be about a 1967 model.  There were three people in the car.  They all waved to Jim and Paulina, and they shouted, “Hi there, you two!”  Jim and Paulina both waved back.  One of those people, a teenage girl, stuck her head out the window as she waved.  Jim asked Paulina, “Do we know those people?”\\n\\n Pam stepped outside as Paulina answered, “No, Jim.  I don’t think so.  They don’t look familiar to me.”\\n\\n Jim said, “I don’t know them, either.  They don’t look familiar to me.”\\n\\n Paulina asked, “Mom, have we sold a Mustang lately, about a 1967 model?”\\n\\n “No, I don’t think so.  The last Mustang I sold was about five weeks ago, a 1972.  And we still have that 1976 Mustang.”\\n\\n Pam got a look at the marquee and said, “Nice job so far, you two.”\\n\\n Pam turned around and started back for the office.  About halfway, she stopped and turned around and asked Jim and Paulina, “Did you two know those folks in that Mustang that just passed by?”\\n\\n Jim said, “No, Pam.  We don’t think so.”\\n\\n Then Paulina said, “They didn’t look familiar to us.”\\n\\n Pam headed back to the office, and Jim and Paulina went back to work.  They finished that one side.  Then they went to the other side, facing uptown.  This side would advertise the Cadillac Seville.  Once again, Jim did a good job.  Just as they got through, Pam opened the car lot. \\n\\n It seemed to be a good day at Gilmore Auto Sales.  Pam asked Jim to help sell the cars.  During the four-hour working period, they managed to sell four cars.  The Pontiac and the Cadillac were not sold.  Jim and Paulina were hoping whoever was driving that Mustang would drive by the place.  They wanted to get a good look at them.  That did not happen.\\n\\n😊\\n\\nA little after one, Pam closed the car lot.  Just as she did, Wendy drove into the lot to pick up Jim.  Audrey and Julie were with her. \\n\\nWendy drove to the Eckerd Drug Store at the corner of Trade and Tryon Streets.  Wendy parked on the side of Tryon Street.  Jim wanted to go into Eckerd’s with Wendy and Audrey, but Julie grabbed Jim by his arm, and she said, “Jim, please come with me to the record store.  There’s something we need to check out.”\\n\\nJim and Julie walked to a record store just a few stores past Eckerd’s.  On the way to the record store, they heard an oldies song coming from a nearby car.  The Coasters.  *That Charlie Brown…he’s gonna get caught!*  Jim asked Julie, “Why are we going to the record store?”\\n\\nJulie answered, “There’s a new record I need to try and find.  I heard the song on the radio yesterday and it sounded good.  I just need someone to go in with me.”\\n\\n Jim and Julie stepped into the record store.  A song was playing.  It was from a group by the name of DeBarge.  *You Wear It Well*.  As soon as Julie heard it, she said, “That’s it, Jim.  That’s the song.”\\n\\n “Julie, I know what you mean.  That sounds like a good song.”\\n\\n Jim and Julie both found a record of that song.  Just as they did, two girls walked to where Jim and Julie were.  One of those girls said, “Hi, Julie.  How’s it going?”\\n\\n Julie knew the girls from school.  She said to them, “Hi, girls.  It’s going okay.  I found that song I was looking for.”\\n\\n One of those girls asked, “Julie, who’s your cute friend there?”\\n\\n Julie answered, “A friend of mine.  Jim Faulkner.  We live next to each other.  He works at that used car lot on Mint Street.”\\n\\n The two girls said together, “Hi, gorgeous!”\\n\\n Jim waved at them.  Then Julie said, “Girls, bad news.  He’s spoken for.”\\n\\n And with that, the girls left.  Julie said, “Don’t worry, Jim.  Just some girls I know from school.  Let’s pay for our records and let’s head back to Eckerd’s to meet our mothers.”\\n\\n After Jim and Julie paid for their records, they headed back to Eckerd’s.  When they got there, Wendy and Audrey were still in the store.  Jim and Julie decided they did not need anything from Eckerd’s, so they went back to Wendy’s Volvo.\\n\\n On the way back home, Julie said to Jim, “I see Pam finally decided to change the sign.”\\n\\n Jim said, “Actually, Paulina and I did that.”\\n\\n “Looks like you two did a very good job,” Audrey said.\\n\\n Then Jim said, “Something strange happened.  While Paulina and I were changing the sign, three people passed us in a Mustang, and they waved at us.”\\n\\n “What did the Mustang look like?” Julie asked.\\n\\n Jim answered, “A 1967 Mustang.  Light blue in color.  There were three people in it.  One, who looked like a teenage girl, stuck her head out the window.”\\n\\n Julie looked at Jim strangely, and she said, “That’s funny.  I don’t know anyone with a car like that.”\\n\\n “Jim, do you have any idea what those three looked like?” Wendy asked.\\n\\n “A man and a woman, both about your age.  And a teenage girl, I’d say around thirteen.”\\n\\n Audrey said, “Those descriptions could fit anyone.”\\n\\nJim said, “I hope I see them again.  I would like to get a better look at them.”\\n\\n Then Wendy asked, “Jim, you don’t think the girl in that Mustang is the one who called you and didn’t tell you who she was?”\\n\\n Jim thought about it for about a minute.  Then he said, “Mom, I don’t know.  I guess I didn’t think much about that.”\\n\\n😊\\n\\nTuesday of that week was Christmas Eve.  Jim went to work at Gilmore Auto Sales.  Paulina was also working.  Pam kept the car lot closed for the day.  There were also some additions.  Pam asked Wendy, Audrey, Malachi and Julie to work some at the car lot.  Pam needed to clean out the office and she needed some extra help.  Wendy and Audrey took down the Christmas lights since no one would be at the car lot until the following Monday (Pam decided to close the car lot for the Christmas week).  Pam got the younger ones to help her clean out the office.  Jim and Malachi helped Pam dispose of old paperwork and old receipts from past automobile sales that had been piling up and cluttering up the office for some time.  Pam, Jim and Malachi put the old papers in big black Hefty bags.  Paulina and Julie were assigned to dust the office furniture, clean the small microwave oven, clean out the small refrigerator (and put in a fresh box of baking soda), and they cleaned out the restroom and the toilet. \\n\\n After Jim and Malachi got the old paperwork and trash into the bags, they took them out of the office.  Jim and Malachi got Julie to help them get the big heavy bags out to the curb.  On the way, Jim said, “I wonder if that girl is gonna call again.  And if she does, I hope to find out who she is.”\\n\\n Julie said, “I’m sure she will.  It’s just not right for her to call you and not tell you who she is.”\\n\\n Then Malachi said, “And you just may wanna find out how she knows you and how she found out about you.”\\n\\n When they got to the curb, they got a look at the Charlotte skyline.  It was barely visible through the fog.  The sky was very cloudy, and there was a chill in the air.  It seemed like this winter was about to be yet another cold one.  Maybe there would be a major winter storm this winter.  But right now, it was not cold enough for snow.  Everyone hoped for snow for Christmas.  The last time it snowed on Christmas in Charlotte was way back in 1947.  That was thirty-eight years ago. \\n\\n They got the bags to the curb and ready for pickup.  Jim said, “I sure hope she calls again.  Maybe the mystery will be revealed.  I hope to find out who she is.”\\n\\n What Jim did not know was this.  She would call again.  And he would find out who she was…and a lot more!\\n\\n😊\\n\\nMonday came.  That morning, Jim went to Eastland Mall, as he planned.  Wendy drove him there.  Charmaine and Jodi went with them.  Jim was ready to meet this girl.  Jim sat at a table in front of Chick-fil-A.  Jodi sat with him.  They both ate a chicken sandwich and drank a cup of Coke.  When the girl called, she asked Jim to meet him around eleven o’ clock.  Jim and Jodi sat and waited.  Eleven o’ clock came.  Nothing.  No sign of her.  Jim and Jodi sat and waited for another hour. A little after noon, Jim and Jodi finally decided to give up and leave Chick-fil-A.  They met Wendy and Charmaine in front of Belk.  Then they went home.  Maybe the girl chose not to show up.  If she did call Jim again, he decided he would not say anything to her about not showing up.\\n\\n Christmas turned out to be pretty good.  Jim got a new color TV set for his bedroom, along with some die-cast metal cars and some cassette tapes.\\n\\n As the week progressed, Wendy took Jim to the parking lot of an abandoned department store on Wilkinson Boulevard.  Wendy taught Jim how to drive.  At this point, Jim had a learner’s permit.  Wendy did not limit Jim’s learning to drive to the parking lot of that abandoned department store.  She did let Jim drive some in the neighborhood, and in some other nearby neighborhoods.  Jim eventually got to drive on Charlotte streets.  He did start out rough, but he got better with time.  By the first week of 1986, Jim would do well enough to get a driver’s license.',\n   'send_replies': True,\n   'spoiler': False,\n   'stickied': False,\n   'subreddit': 'creativewriting',\n   'subreddit_id': 't5_2r69u',\n   'subreddit_subscribers': 217426,\n   'subreddit_type': 'public',\n   'suggested_sort': 'confidence',\n   'thumbnail': 'self',\n   'title': 'Friends and Family (Chapter 19) Part 2',\n   'total_awards_received': 0,\n   'treatment_tags': [],\n   'upvote_ratio': 1.0,\n   'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/t2t2bm/friends_and_family_chapter_19_part_2/',\n   'whitelist_status': 'all_ads',\n   'wls': 6},\n  {'all_awardings': [],\n   'allow_live_comments': False,\n   'author': 'Financial_Board_9010',\n   'author_flair_css_class': None,\n   'author_flair_richtext': [],\n   'author_flair_text': None,\n   'author_flair_type': 'text',\n   'author_fullname': 't2_ifollpk9',\n   'author_is_blocked': False,\n   'author_patreon_flair': False,\n   'author_premium': False,\n   'awarders': [],\n   'can_mod_post': False,\n   'contest_mode': False,\n   'created_utc': 1645982698,\n   'domain': 'self.Financial_Board_9010',\n   'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Financial_Board_9010/comments/t2t27e/technology_and_modernity_in_saudi_arabia/',\n   'gildings': {},\n   'id': 't2t27e',\n   'is_created_from_ads_ui': False,\n   'is_crosspostable': True,\n   'is_meta': False,\n   'is_original_content': False,\n   'is_reddit_media_domain': False,\n   'is_robot_indexable': True,\n   'is_self': True,\n   'is_video': False,\n   'link_flair_background_color': '',\n   'link_flair_richtext': [],\n   'link_flair_text_color': 'dark',\n   'link_flair_type': 'text',\n   'locked': False,\n   'media_only': False,\n   'no_follow': True,\n   'num_comments': 0,\n   'num_crossposts': 0,\n   'over_18': False,\n   'permalink': '/r/u_Financial_Board_9010/comments/t2t27e/technology_and_modernity_in_saudi_arabia/',\n   'pinned': False,\n   'retrieved_on': 1645982708,\n   'score': 1,\n   'selftext': 'In the modern age, where a country must keep up to date on science and technology if it is to have a hope of keeping up with the western world, Saudi Arabia is unlike many other Islamic countries.',\n   'send_replies': True,\n   'spoiler': False,\n   'stickied': False,\n   'subreddit': 'u_Financial_Board_9010',\n   'subreddit_id': 't5_5nelsd',\n   'subreddit_subscribers': 0,\n   'subreddit_type': 'user',\n   'suggested_sort': 'qa',\n   'thumbnail': 'self',\n   'title': 'Technology and Modernity in Saudi Arabia',\n   'total_awards_received': 0,\n   'treatment_tags': [],\n   'upvote_ratio': 1.0,\n   'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Financial_Board_9010/comments/t2t27e/technology_and_modernity_in_saudi_arabia/'},\n  {'all_awardings': [],\n   'allow_live_comments': False,\n   'author': 'emilyalive',\n   'author_flair_css_class': None,\n   'author_flair_richtext': [],\n   'author_flair_text': None,\n   'author_flair_type': 'text',\n   'author_fullname': 't2_zd5cf',\n   'author_is_blocked': False,\n   'author_patreon_flair': False,\n   'author_premium': False,\n   'awarders': [],\n   'can_mod_post': False,\n   'contest_mode': False,\n   'created_utc': 1645982590,\n   'domain': 'self.DentalAssistant',\n   'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/DentalAssistant/comments/t2t0s8/any_das_who_have_also_worked_in_a_labas_a_dental/',\n   'gildings': {},\n   'id': 't2t0s8',\n   'is_created_from_ads_ui': False,\n   'is_crosspostable': True,\n   'is_meta': False,\n   'is_original_content': False,\n   'is_reddit_media_domain': False,\n   'is_robot_indexable': True,\n   'is_self': True,\n   'is_video': False,\n   'link_flair_background_color': '#dadada',\n   'link_flair_richtext': [{'e': 'text', 't': 'Education'}],\n   'link_flair_template_id': '5841ee68-6419-11ea-b0f3-0e9dd5a1bb99',\n   'link_flair_text': 'Education',\n   'link_flair_text_color': 'dark',\n   'link_flair_type': 'richtext',\n   'locked': False,\n   'media_only': False,\n   'no_follow': True,\n   'num_comments': 0,\n   'num_crossposts': 0,\n   'over_18': False,\n   'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads',\n   'permalink': '/r/DentalAssistant/comments/t2t0s8/any_das_who_have_also_worked_in_a_labas_a_dental/',\n   'pinned': False,\n   'pwls': 6,\n   'retrieved_on': 1645982600,\n   'score': 1,\n   'selftext': 'Hi all!

However, I currently work as a processor (learning waxing and finishing now) in a dental lab (removables). I love what I do currently and want to learn as much as I can in the lab before being chairside, possibly learning tooth setting before I graduate if I feel confident enough with my waxes and finishes. \\n\\nI know I don’t want to be in the lab forever—and I’m wondering if any other DAs have experience as a dental tech as well. If so, is there one you prefer over the other? And with the overlap in skills, has it given you any extra leverage in the job market? Would love to hear anyone’s experience, thanks!! ☺️',\n   'send_replies': True,\n   'spoiler': False,\n   'stickied': False,\n   'subreddit': 'DentalAssistant',\n   'subreddit_id': 't5_3jubf',\n   'subreddit_subscribers': 3386,\n   'subreddit_type': 'public',\n   'thumbnail': 'self',\n   'title': 'Any DAs who have also worked in a lab/as a dental technician here?',\n   'total_awards_received': 0,\n   'treatment_tags': [],\n   'upvote_ratio': 1.0,\n   'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/DentalAssistant/comments/t2t0s8/any_das_who_have_also_worked_in_a_labas_a_dental/',\n   'whitelist_status': 'all_ads',\n   'wls': 6},\n  {'all_awardings': [],\n   'allow_live_comments': False,\n   'author': 'AfternoonSnack187',\n   'author_flair_css_class': None,\n   'author_flair_richtext': [],\n   'author_flair_text': None,\n   'author_flair_type': 'text',\n   'author_fullname': 't2_jiy8eway',\n   'author_is_blocked': False,\n   'author_patreon_flair': False,\n   'author_premium': False,\n   'awarders': [],\n   'can_mod_post': False,\n   'contest_mode': False,\n   'created_utc': 1645982541,\n   'domain': 'self.dirtypenpals',\n   'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/t2t05d/f4f_taking_down_the_glutton_corporation/',\n   'gildings': {},\n   'id': 't2t05d',\n   'is_created_from_ads_ui': False,\n   'is_crosspostable': True,\n   'is_meta': False,\n   'is_original_content': False,\n   'is_reddit_media_domain': False,\n   'is_robot_indexable': True,\n   'is_self': True,\n   'is_video': False,\n   'link_flair_background_color': '#373c3f',\n   'link_flair_css_class': 'roleplay',\n   'link_flair_richtext': [],\n   'link_flair_template_id': '7c7670ac-00d5-11e6-8766-0ed56c038c65',\n   'link_flair_text': 'Long Term RP',\n   'link_flair_text_color': 'light',\n   'link_flair_type': 'text',\n   'locked': False,\n   'media_only': False,\n   'no_follow': True,\n   'num_comments': 0,\n   'num_crossposts': 0,\n   'over_18': True,\n   'parent_whitelist_status': 'no_ads',\n   'permalink': '/r/dirtypenpals/comments/t2t05d/f4f_taking_down_the_glutton_corporation/',\n   'pinned': False,\n   'pwls': 0,\n   'retrieved_on': 1645982551,\n   'score': 1,\n   'selftext': 'A year ago, a virus caused a worldwide pandemic that forced people to stay in, people weren\\'t allowed to visit public places, the fear of contracting the virus sent chills to the spine of every single one of them, and because of this, none of them were able to leave their houses ever since. It\\'s been a month ever since it had been announced, we were finally able to roam the open world again, and everyone went back to their normal lives. You were supposed to leave your town in order to live with her years earlier, but due to the pandemic, your plans were cancelled, and you were forced to meet her a few years later. You\\'ve gained a considerable amount of weight, the laziness and lack of exercise was the main reason as to why this had happened, but there was another reason, one that would make people judge you if you ever mentioned it to them. You liked big women, the feeling of your clothes tightening and sinking in to your fat while you eat massive amounts of food felt hot to you, you were an insatiable glutton with a desire to eat as much as possible, pushing yourself to your limits every single night in order to gain a few pounds. When it was time for you to move, you panicked, you felt that she might hate you due to your new, pudgy figure, you even thought that she might badmouth you for being such a fatass. After arriving to her city, you couldn\\'t help but notice but feel different, the people around you looked a bit strange, thats when you bumped into another lady, however, she was the same size as you, she had blue sparkly eyes alongside her blonde hair colour, donning a blac dress that was clearly having trouble keeping her fat in. Momentarily, she apologized before walking off, now that you think about it, all of the women around you seem to be rather chubbier than usual, however you didn\\'t mind it at all, brushing it off as some kind of dream. Finally, you were able to arrive to her home, a two story modern house, surrounded by a gate and a garden in front of it. As you walked by the pathway leading to the door, you couldn\\'t help but feel nervous, what if she hates you? What if she doesn\\'t accept you for being such a blubber ball? You shivered, holding your bags tightly as you pressed on the doorbell, and for a few seconds there was silence. It started to feel like forever as you thought to yourself, thinking of what might happen next, you decided that it\\'s best for you to leave, fearing that she may never accept you, as you turn around, the door behind you opened. Turning your head around, you couldn\\'t help but be amazed, she was about the same size as you, the same height too, it was like looking at a mirror. You phased out for a few seconds, before the fat woman called out to your name, welcoming you with a warm welcome, her body fat serving as a furnace of sorts, you couldn\\'t help but wonder. How did she get so big? What happened? And why is it hot? You heard a chuckle, as the womans says in a soft and gentle voice\\n\\n\"Welcome home, sweetie..~\"\\n\\nHiya! If you\\'re still reading here then, congratulations! This is a basic summary of my plot, it\\'s a post pandemic weight gain roleplay in which you play the character that\\'s moving in to my home! Naturally there\\'s multiple ways that we could play this out, we could either be sisters, friends or even long distance lovers! I\\'ve gotten rather big since our last meeting, and who knows? Yet there\\'s something about me and the place that we\\'re living with in that makes you uneasy, and it\\'s up to you to finding the key to solving this mystery\\n\\nI wanted to make it so that it\\'s secretive, my character suspects you of having a fat fetish, while your character pretty much feels the same, suspecting me of having the same kink, and it will eventually lead to them discovering each other\\'s fetish, there\\'s multiple plot points that I wanted to incorporate in this story such as different ways of gaining weight, story and so much more!\\n\\nI expect you to be at least fairly literate, I don\\'t need you to write out a whole book per reply, I just want someone who doesn\\'t do one-liners, its okay if you\\'re a male playing a female! Long as both characters are female then we should be all good! I wanted this roleplay to be semi-realistic too, I just enjoy seeing the detail when the other stuffs themselves with so much food as their belly churns, groaning in pain as it was placed on top of the table\\n\\nThis will be long-term, so please if possible, no ghosting, I would understand if something is wrong or if you\\'re busy, that\\'s alright since our real lives are more important than just roleplay, but if you\\'re disliking the roleplay as we continue, please tell me instead of ghosting me\\n\\nWell, that\\'s all that I have for this prompt right now! Other details will be explained in DMs, please don\\'t leave me simple blank hello messages, introduce yourself! So if this catches your eye and interests you? Hit me up! I hope to see you soon! If you\\'ve been reading up to here, please tell me what your favorite color is upon messaging me!\\n\\nKinks: Weight Gain, Chugging, Mutual Gain, Force Feeding, Stuckage, Burping, Science Materials, Belly Play, Teasing, Hugging, Wholesome Relationships, Bloating, Tight Clothes, Feeding, Overstuffed Bellies, Overstuffing\\n\\nLimits: Vore, Scat, Watersports\\n\\nThanks for Reading!',\n   'send_replies': True,\n   'spoiler': False,\n   'stickied': False,\n   'subreddit': 'dirtypenpals',\n   'subreddit_id': 't5_2sbbv',\n   'subreddit_subscribers': 429563,\n   'subreddit_type': 'public',\n   'thumbnail': 'nsfw',\n   'title': '[F4F] Taking down the Glutton Corporation',\n   'total_awards_received': 0,\n   'treatment_tags': [],\n   'upvote_ratio': 1.0,\n   'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/t2t05d/f4f_taking_down_the_glutton_corporation/',\n   'whitelist_status': 'no_ads',\n   'wls': 0},\n  {'all_awardings': [],\n   'allow_live_comments': False,\n   'author': 'professionalcorses',\n   'author_flair_css_class': None,\n   'author_flair_richtext': [],\n   'author_flair_text': None,\n   'author_flair_type': 'text',\n   'author_fullname': 't2_jydo5vbj',\n   'author_is_blocked': False,\n   'author_patreon_flair': False,\n   'author_premium': False,\n   'awarders': [],\n   'can_mod_post': False,\n   'contest_mode': False,\n   'created_utc': 1645982507,\n   'domain': 'self.professionalcorses',\n   'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/u_professionalcorses/comments/t2szoe/top_10_data_science_courses_in_bangalore/',\n   'gildings': {},\n   'id': 't2szoe',\n   'is_created_from_ads_ui': False,\n   'is_crosspostable': True,\n   'is_meta': False,\n   'is_original_content': False,\n   'is_reddit_media_domain': False,\n   'is_robot_indexable': True,\n   'is_self': True,\n   'is_video': False,\n   'link_flair_background_color': '',\n   'link_flair_richtext': [],\n   'link_flair_text_color': 'dark',\n   'link_flair_type': 'text',\n   'locked': False,\n   'media_only': False,\n   'no_follow': True,\n   'num_comments': 0,\n   'num_crossposts': 0,\n   'over_18': False,\n   'permalink': '/r/u_professionalcorses/comments/t2szoe/top_10_data_science_courses_in_bangalore/',\n   'pinned': False,\n   'post_hint': 'self',\n   'preview': {'enabled': False,\n    'images': [{'id': 'TaahW29hczZ5h042Txt9rJGvQkLQfR2Y6CQXU7eMOYY',\n      'resolutions': [{'height': 60,\n        'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/UQX_eD6onm0cDzTRipPc7r69NEn0-zHhAUHNf1B_QLU.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0361ce237479508fef5c2cfcab38df23d7f0434b',\n        'width': 108},\n       {'height': 121,\n        'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/UQX_eD6onm0cDzTRipPc7r69NEn0-zHhAUHNf1B_QLU.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=801700c2da9f80a27d8812a0d8748dfb4b9d2141',\n        'width': 216},\n       {'height': 180,\n        'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/UQX_eD6onm0cDzTRipPc7r69NEn0-zHhAUHNf1B_QLU.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41d18a97231432ca4fc860f071f4291becd736bd',\n        'width': 320},\n       {'height': 360,\n        'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/UQX_eD6onm0cDzTRipPc7r69NEn0-zHhAUHNf1B_QLU.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26b46591b290c47aaaaeb3774598bd43ee02a4fb',\n        'width': 640},\n       {'height': 540,\n        'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/UQX_eD6onm0cDzTRipPc7r69NEn0-zHhAUHNf1B_QLU.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=284d5170ecece80ca026d7fe22ac5c9d8ec210f5',\n        'width': 960},\n       {'height': 607,\n        'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/UQX_eD6onm0cDzTRipPc7r69NEn0-zHhAUHNf1B_QLU.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05333948e0a366a8113134cb9186a99d9ee0faaf',\n        'width': 1080}],\n      'source': {'height': 720,\n       'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/UQX_eD6onm0cDzTRipPc7r69NEn0-zHhAUHNf1B_QLU.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=4e2a2df29cfa3d98efffce00d85a579923aedbc5',\n       'width': 1280},\n      'variants': {}}]},\n   'retrieved_on': 1645982518,\n   'score': 1,\n   'selftext': ' ***The*** [Data Scientist Course](https://www.henryharvin.com/blog/data-science-courses-bangalore/)***offers extensive training on the most in-demand Data Science and Machine Learning skills with hands-on exposure to key tools and  aims to extract valuable insights from a vast collection of data.

But I am curious about other experiences.\\n\\nI\\'m reading:\\n\\n**Emotional Neglect and Complex PTSD By Pete Walker** an 11 page paper linked from the Wiki.  He spends a lot of time talking about the belittling and dismissive emotional neglect, and the toxic effects. He also says that lots of kids don\\'t recognize it as abuse. Most of his examples are \"active measures\" by the parent, even if active means \"turning away and ignoring\"\\n\\nI don\\'t know how to characterize what happened to me.   I never felt that I couldn\\'t go to them and ask for help.  But I didn\\'t want to.  Once I waited until a skinned knee had an infection the size of a quarter and hurting a lot before asking my mom.  (Age 6?  Age 8? Old enough I was bathing myself.)  Shows how much I kept to myself that she didn\\'t notice.  It was summer.  I was in shorts all the time.   Another time I was playing with fire, and spilled burning mineral spirits on my hand, resulting in a big blister on my thumb.  After a few hours of trying to tough it out, I brought it to my dad who promptly lanced the blister, put a burn salve on it, and wrapped it.  This felt much better.  I explained how it happened.  Didn\\'t get in trouble for it.  Asked me how I would keep it from happening again.\\n\\nBut why was I reluctant to take my owies to my parents? Fear of disapproval?  \\n\\nI don\\'t remember receiving their disapproval for much of anything.   But I don\\'t remember their approval much either.   I think they were pleased when I won a minor prize in a regional science fair in grade 8, but I don\\'t remember them being there. There was an underlying expectation that someone of my smarts should be bringing home more A\\'s and fewer C\\'s, but there weren\\'t incentives for As or disapproval for C\\'s\\n\\nBoth parents were chronically sick and didn\\'t have a lot of energy. There was always hot supper. Mom bought me clothes until I was 12 and got a paper route.  My allowance stopped.    I was proud of that.  Meant I had taken a step toward independence. Mom helped me with the paper route book keeping.\\n\\nSo it wasn\\'t like I was totally neglected.  I played chess with my father.  I had toys and puzzles. I don\\'t remember making envious comparisons to other kids.  Every Tuesday from grade 3 onward was Library night.  I was pretty much illiterate at the end of grade 2.  (Class of 50) So it was a stack of books every week, and after school I would perch on the stool in the kitchen and read out loud to my mom while she was making supper.  I remember Dad reading Winnie the Pooh both of us in a big overstuffed floral print chair (18\" poppies or peonies).  Snuggled beside him, warm and safe.   \\n\\nBut I don\\'t remember hugs. I don\\'t remember my parents demonstrating affection for each other.\\n\\nUsing the list elsewhere in the FAQ, I have a lot of the symptoms (41/56) that correlate with CPTSD, but I don\\'t have anything overt happening.  Now that I\\'m aware of what they are, I sense the odd \"emo flashback\"  E.g. this morning, before getting up, I felt fear, but no elevated breathing or pulse.  I wanted to hide.  I thought, \"I need to hide harder\"  Odd phrasing that.   Writing about it now, I can trigger that a little bit.  Seems to come with a bit of dissociation.  Have I had these all along, but only with learning about this chaotic illness started to notice?  Or is it that now, since I\\'m trying to dig in, that hidden chunks are saying, \"He\\'s listening. Boy are we going to give him an earful\"  If the latter they are still trying to remember how to talk.\\n\\nBut everything is always so vague.  Mist demons.   Nailing fog to the barn door.  Trying to fix the car engine that almost runs right most of the time.\\n\\nI \\\\*really\\\\* wish that I had an owner\\'s manual.\\n\\nMy first therapy appointment is Wednesday.

You can get programmatic access to all of that: pages, pageviews, user contributions, etc.\n\n### Wikipedia API\n\nWikimedia Foundation hosts several initiatives (e.g.,  Wikipedia, Wikibooks, Wikidata, etc.). All of the Wikimedia Wikis have specific endpoints. For example, an English Wikipedia has the following endpoint - https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php. For more examples, check out https://mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page. \n\nFurther, there are several necessary parameters that are required in an URL string:\n- `action`\n- `format`\n- and some combination of `list`, `prop`, or `meta` depending on the requirement\n\n`action` tells the endpoint what type of action is to be performed. For requesting data, we need `action` to be `query`. We will ask for the data in JSON format, so `format` is set to `json`. Finally, there are three broad types of query actions we can perform:\n\n   - prop (https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/API:Properties) - get properties of pages  \n   - list (https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/API:Lists) - get list of pages matching a certain criterion\n   - meta (https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/API:Meta) - get meta information about the wiki and user\n\n\nThe rest of the parameters will depend on the type of query action that is to be performed.",

In the homework for this week, you designed a small dataset of pageviews for British male and female mathematicians. Let's assume you plan to release this dataset online.\n\nHow would you structure your Datasheet for this small dataset? For this week's homework, please answer the following questions:",

One of them is WikiWho by fabian flöck of the Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n\nFrom https://f-squared.org/wikiwho/:\n> the core functionality of wikiwho is to parse the complete set of all historical revisions (versions) of a wikipedia article in order to find out who wrote and/or removed which exact text at what point in time. this means that given a specific revision of an article (e.g., the current one) wikiwho can determine for each word and special character which user first introduced that word and if and how it was deleted/reintroduced afterwards. this functionality is not offered by wikipedia as such and wikiwho was shown to perform this task with very high accuracy (~95%) and very efficiently, being the only tool that has been scientifically proven to perform this task that well\n\nWikiWho is a service that reports the editions on Wikipedia articles. Have a look at what it outputs for the ‘Oxford Internet Institute’ page:\n\n<a href=\"https://api.wikiwho.net/en/api/v1.0.0-beta/rev_content/Oxford Internet Institute/?o_rev_id=true&editor=true&token_id=true&out=true&in=true\">Oxford Internet Institute through the WikiWho API</a>\n\nWhat sort of research could you do using WikiWho?\n\n</div>",
